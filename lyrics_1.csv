0,Johnny Horton,1,The Battle Of New Orleans,1959,"

[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 3]
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

[Chorus]
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)

[Verse 5]
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

1,George Jones,2,White Lightning,1959,"

Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy and he had him a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
Shhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff
He took one s-slug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'...

2,Jim Reeves,3,Home,1959,"

Well, I've been a traveler most of my life
Never took a home, never took a wife
Ran away young and decided to roam
Wanna see my mama and my daddy back home

CHORUS:
Home, where the river runs cold
The water tastes good, the winters ain't cold
Home, where the trees grow tall
The home fires burn, the whippoorwills call

I remember stories that my daddy used to tell
My eyes would get big, and his chest would swell
I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

REPEAT CHORUS

Well, mama dear, mama do you still love your boy
After all my roamin' can I still bring you joy
Mom sent a letter, got it not long ago
She said ""come home, I'm missin' you so

"
3,George Morgan,4,I'm In Love Again,1959,"

Not so long ago I had my poor heart broken
I said crazy heart see what a fool you've been
Now I've met you and although we've barely spoken
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

I'm in love again and wedding bells are ringing
I'm so happy I'm afraid this dream might end
Live each day as though the last my heart keeps singing
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

[Instrumental Break]

When she left me I was sure my world had ended
And I couldn't even speak to our friends
And then just as my poor heart was getting mended
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

I'm in love again and wedding bells are ringing
I'm so happy I'm afraid this dream might end
Live each day as though the last my heart keeps singing
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

"
4,Ray Price,5,Heartaches By The Number,1959,"

Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more

Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number
And the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world will end

"
5,Webb Pierce,6,A Thousand Miles Ago,1959,"

There's a thousand miles in back of me and many more to go
Ridin' on a freight train feeling mighty low
I keep-a wonderin' why she quit me but I guess I'll never know
Yeah she used to be my baby a thousand miles ago

A thousand miles ago I started feelin' bad
'Cause I just lost the future I thought I really had
I know I shouldn't feel this way but I still love her so
I can't keep from thinkin' about a thousand miles ago

I know I've held her in my arms a thousand times or more
Promised her a world of love 'til I learned the score
That's why I'm feeling lonesome, that's why I'm feeling low
Yeah she used to be my baby a thousand miles ago

A thousand miles ago I started feelin' bad
'Cause I just lost the future I thought I really had
I know I shouldn't feel this way but I still love her so
I can't keep from thinkin' about a thousand miles ago

6,Frankie Miller,7,Black Land Farmer,1959,"

[Intro]
Giddy-up, here, boy

[Verse 1]
When the Lord made me, he made a simple man
Not much money and not much land
He didn't make me no banker or legal charmer
When the Lord made me he made a Blackland farmer

[Verse 2]
Well my hands ain't smooth, my face is rough
But my heart is warm and my ways ain't tough
I guess I'm the luckiest man ever born
'Cause the Lord gave me health and a Blackland farm

[Verse 3]
Breakin' up the new ground early in the day
Gonna plant cotton, I'm gonna plant hay
I love the smell of sweet breeze blowin' through the corn
Lord you sure done me right by my Blackland farm

[Vers3 4]
I feel like I'm a-gettin' closer to you, God
A plow in the ground and a-breakin' up the sod
Well, my mind is at ease and I could do no harm
Lord, I owe it all to you and my Blackland farm

"
7,Skeeter Davis,8,Set Him Free,1959,"

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

Order in the court
You swear to tell the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
So help you God
Yes, I do

Judge, I've never believed in divorces
Unless they just have to be
But after you've heard my story
Then I know you'll set this man free

It began right after the wedding
She cheated and she lied
Right from the start
And I could see from the way they were headed
This woman would soon break his heart

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

The three of us were always best of friends
But when I leave this courtroom, judge
I know our friendship ends
If you could have heard the awful things I've heard her say
While she called him names and slapped his face
And he'd just turn away

And the nights we went out for fun
It was also plain to see then
She danced all night with someone else
And leaved him there with me

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

Now I ask you, judge to understand
Think it over slowly
You see
I fell in love with
And I dont care who knows
I respect him as a husband
And I treat him like a man
I know I could help him find more happiness than this woman ever can

Well, Judge, you've heard my story
It's as true as true can be
I've even told you that I love him
So Judge, won't you please set him free?

Set him free
Set him free
For I love him, you see

"
8,Johnny Cash,9,Luther Played The Boogie,1959,"

[Verse: Johnny Cash]
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band
With a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs
That'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was
Ooh-wee

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
When Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie
In the strangest kind of way
Play it strange!

Well, we did our best to entertain
Everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off
To give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make them get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make them move was
Ooh-wee

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now, didn't Luther play the boogie strange?

"
9,Johnny Horton,10,When It's Springtime In Alaska (It's Forty Below),1959,"

I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)

It was red headed Lil who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Escimo hop all around the saloon
Where the cariboo crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiac rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
[ banjo ]
I was as innocent as I could be I didn't know Lil was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below
(When it's springtime in Alaska he'll be six feet below)

"
10,Johnny Cash,11,Frankie's Man  Johnny,1959,"

[Verse]
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track
He said, ""I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong""
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinking about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doing  her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said, ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right""

[Outro]
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

11,Carl Belew,12,Am I That Easy To Forget,1959,"

(Am I that easy to forget)
You say you've found somebody new but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away forget the love I had for you
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret am I that easy to forget
(Am I that easy to forget)
Before you leave be sure you find you want his love much more than mine
Cause I'll just say we've never met if I'm that easy to forget
(Am I that easy to forget)

Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret you're not that easy to forget
(Am I that easy to forget)
Before you leave be sure...

12,Johnny Cash,14,You Dreamer You,1959,"

[Verse]
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you""
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower

[Outro]
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife[x2]
You dreamer you[x2]

13,Johnny Cash,15,Thanks A Lot,1959,"

[Verse]
You're telling everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're calling me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

[Outro]
No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot

14,Margie,16,Poor Old Heartsick Me,1959,
15,Ernest Tubb,17,I Cried A Tear,1959,"

It amazes me how she can change my mind
When it seems to be impossible she can do it everytime
And the way she always loves me she's got that down perfect too
I keep asking myself what is it the lady can't do
She brightens any room she walks inside
And the way she comes in smiling you'd never think she ever cries
She still looks as young and pretty as she did the day we met
If there's one thing bad about her I ain't found it yet
What it is my woman can't do can't be done
If there's ever been a darling I've got one
She beats all I've ever seen she's the champion of our team
What my woman can't do can't be done what my woman can't do can't be done

A-going tick-tock
Listen to the rain
On the window pane
Everything's quiet
Quiet as a mouse
In this lonesome old house
In this lonesome old house

Everything's dark
Dark outside
Stars don't shine
In the sky
Here I sit
No one about
In this lonesome old house
In this lonesome old house

All the love and laughter and sunshine
Left when she said goodbye
There's no longer the sweet, sweet lips
And that lovin'
That sweet lovin' smile
So let it be said
If your love is true
You be good to her
She'll be good to you
And don't you end up
Being without
In a lonesome old house
In a lonesome old house

18,Johnny Cash,20,Don't Take Your Guns To Town,1959,"

[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 2]
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 3]
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 4]
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 5]
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

I just heard the saddest news somebody's back in town
And I know just what he's gonna do
He'll pick up where he left off his last time around
Oh how it hurts to keep on losing you

Somebody's back in town to steal your love from me
The fear I've had so long is now reality
The only chance I have is when he throws you down
My chance is gone somebody's back in town

I know that I can't change your ways
We've been through that before
His trap is set and you will walk right in
He only wants a fly by night affair and nothing more
And you're just fool enough to fall again

SomebodyaÃ,Â€Ã,Â™s back in town why canaÃ,Â€Ã,Â™t he stay away
You should know he never loved you anyway
He'll let you live a little then he'll throw you down
Sad news today somebody's back in town

Where there’s dim lights and there’s liqueur, they’ll find you each night
The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
You’re the loneliest fool that’s living in your make believe world
You’re a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody’s girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that I’m to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sordid world
You’re a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody’s girl
You can’t say I didn’t love you as you’re crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
You’re a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody’s girl
I don’t understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls
You’re a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody’s girl
You’re a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody’s girl

I go to see my little girl
Each Sunday afternoon
And how I dread the words I know she'll say
She'll ask me when I'm coming home
I'll answer pretty soon
But I know I'm just her mommy for a day

She's much too young to realize
Why mommy can't come home
And that her daddy wanted things this way
We kiss goodbye
And my heart breaks to walk away alone
To have to be her mommy for a day

I loved her dad with all my heart
They lied and ruined our home
Oh, why did he believe the things they said
I pray in time he'll change his mind
And take me back once more
Then I'll not be her mommy for a day
She's much too young to realize...

Are there any memories you're keeping in your heart
Could there be an old old flame that might keep us apart

Well there can be no other love that is if you want me

And that's the way it's gotta be

Arms that love one woman that's how it is with me

You tell me that you're so in love but is it all with me

I remember when you said that you were mine alone

Still I can't convince my heart that you're my very own

And if I find you've been untrue you've seen the last of me

And that's the way it's gotta be

And that's the way it's gotta be

Moi j'ai un tas de choses à dire sur toi
T'as tes défauts, tu crois quoi ?
On dirait que tu t'es focalisé sur mes soucis
A croire que t'as pas grand chose dans la vie
A part ton chat et tes faux amis
Et puis bien sur moi
Alors laisse-moi me mettre la race
J'suis trop honnête je suis trop lucide
Une fois bourré j'sais être honnête
Comme dans les scènes de cinéma
Comme dans les scènes de cinéma
Je sais être simple et me laisser aimer
Vas-y rempli la coupe faut
Faut que ça déborde comme tsunami

[Pont : Eddy Jimmy Martin & Anton Serra]
Quelle idée d'aimer les gens ?
C'est l'effet papillave
C'est l'effet papillave
Quelle idée d'aider les gens ?
C'est l'effet papillave
C'est l'effet papillave
Rappelez-vous les actes immondes que vous avez commis sous l'effet de l'alcool

[Couplet 2 : Anton Serra]
J'ai tout mon esprit sans spiritueux
Une bonne élocution dans les soirées périlleuses
J'esquive les coins truffés de couteaux papillons
Voilà un des bons côtés de l'effet papillave
Mais putain qu'est-ce que je m'ennuie
Sans alcool c'est chaque fois ""Allez, bonne nuit""
Vous m'avez saoulé, enfin façon de parler
Deux heures pour aller d'un point A à un point B
Je comprends que l'tiers d'vos phrases
Y'a moins de psychologie que de comptoirs
Vu la gueule de vos femmes, mes frandchien, demain vous allez prendre cher
En tout cas moi j'ai passé une soirée d'enculé, reculez, vous puez
Tellement de la gueule, ça dégueule c'est dégueux fait pitié tu sais plus où tu es
Tout comme toi, j'aurais préféré le black-out
Putain dire que je suis dans cet état quand je suis KO
Oui je dois l'avouer on rigole moins, soirée karaoké au cacao
Bande d'handicapés sans macarons
L'avantage papillave c'est qu'on dépense moins, donc on pense plus
Donc moins de risque de tomber sur un regard de trav'
De se marrav', de finir en gardav', des soirées carafes d'eau
Allez j'arrache ma carcasse pour un émincé de poulet paprika
C'est l'effet papillave
Sous les applaudissements d'ma copine
Je suis rentré à la mais' sans haleine fétide
Fatigué et saoulé de Cherry Coke
A cette heure-ci les Kirikou sont encore sous le jerrycan
Chéri écoute j'ai passé toute la night au cola, je surenchéris
Mais certainement en manque de chocolat
J'me suis empiffré de Mon Chéri

Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you

I belong to another whose arms have grown cold
But I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the will to be true

Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you but darling I do
Please help me I'm falling in love with you

30,Jim Reeves,2,He'll Have To Go,1960,"

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you want me, answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

"
31,Don Gibson,3,Just One Time,1960,"

If I could see you just one time oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time and then pretend that you're still mine
Lips that used to thrill me so they now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine wish I could see you just one time
I I I I miss you so oh I need you so
I I I'd give this heart of mine if I could see you just one time

I I I I miss you so...

"
32,Ray Price,4,One More Time,1960,"

I wonder what the power is that you hold over me
I never get to love you long just your memory
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you one more time my arms will hold you
But it won't belong until you're gone with a mem'ry left behind
And I just know that when you go I'll be lonely one more time
[ steel ]
Your nearness makes me weaken and I give into you
And I'm doing all the things I said that I wouldn't do
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you...

33,Buck Owens,5,Above And Beyond,1960,"

Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never, ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

Well a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money, if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you

Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never, ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree

And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

34,Stonewall Jackson,6,Why I'm Walkin',1960,"

I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart now I ain't talkin'
The little hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind life's not worth livin'
I breathe her name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why could I never see how much she meant to me
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'

With an old love on your mind...

35,Jeanne Black,7,He'll Have To Stay,1960,"

I am glad you've finally called me on the phone
I've been waiting here tonight but not alone
You broke the date that we had made just yesterday
Now there's someone else who's here, he'll have to stay

I have found another love I know is true
And he holds me much more tenderly than you
Loving you's not worth the price I have to pay
Someone else is in your place, he'll have to stay

Once I loved you with all my heart
But now I must say no
You broke my heart too many times
So now you'll have to go

I can hear the jukebox playing soft and low
And you're out again with someone else, I know
My love was blind, I'm not your kind that's all I'll say
So you can hang up, I'm in his arms, he'll have to stay

Now someone else is in your place, he'll have to stay

"
36,Roy Drusky,8,Another,1960,"

There'll always be another, then another
And another just like me

You didn't lo-ove me long until the thrill was gone
Then another made me your old used to be
How long can his love last when the new lose love so fast
There'll always be another, then another
And another just like me

Just like me he'll understa-and the sorrow
Of lovin' you today and losin' you tomorrow
I'd warn him, but he'd call it jealousy
So let him be another, then another
And another just like me

You'll go anywhere for a brand new love affair
Somebody new who thrills you instantly
But when the thrill has ceased to chill
And from your past, I know it will
There'll always be another, then another
And another just like me

Just like me he'll understa-and the sorrow
Of lovin' you today and losin' you tomorrow
I'd warn him, but he'd call it jealousy
So let him be another, then another
And another just like me

"
37,Marty Robbins,9,Big Iron,1960,"

[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

38,Kitty Wells,10,Left To Right,1960,"

I'm taking your ring from my left hand
Since you've made it plain we must part
But I'm placing it on my right hand
To show the world that I once possessed your heart

From left to right means goodbye
Oh what a small ring can do
I'm left with these heartaches but I'll always have
The right kind of love for you

I'll wear it my darling forever
Tho' you did me wrong I'm not ashamed
When asked who's the giver the tears may fall
But proudly I'll tell them your name

From left to right I've made the change
Tho' the diamond still shines just as bright
As the day that you gave it and my love's as strong
Though I'm changing from left to right

"
39,Johnny Horton,11,Sink The Bismark,1960,"

In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And evry British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We'll find that German battleship thats makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day
The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away
The mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""Put ev'ry ship a-sail""
Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta send the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its' run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""Turn those bows around""
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismark"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
We found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down

40,Faron Young,12,Your Old Used To Be,1960,"

Will I ever get used to being your old used to be
I watched you walk away from me so long ago
I didn't know I loved you and I let you go
And just to think that I'm the one who set you free
Will I ever get used to being your old used to be
I've gotten used to people's stares as I walk by
I keep my head bowed low so they can't see me cry
They say there goes a man who lives in a memory
Will I ever get used to being your old used to be

I've got no one to help me pass these lonely days
When night time comes I just can't keep the blues away
Or if I dream your lovely face is all I see
Will I ever get used to being your old used to be
I've gotten used to...

"
41,Johnny Cash,13,Smiling Bill McCall,1960,"

[Verse]
Well, the whole town listened to the radio
For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
Everyone in Nashville
Was listening to Bill
I don't want to be laying in bed
When they pronounce me dead
He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
With his guitar hanging to his knee bone
All the girls just sat and dreamed
When Bill began his song
I don't want my hat to be hung
When my last song is sung
But he never let fame go to his head
This is Smiling Bill McCall, he said
Going to pick and sing a song or two
You all listen until I'm through
And if you're at the house or in your car
Tune in this time tomorrow
To all the boys he was a big hero
They'd glue their ears to the radio
Then talking a most unusual drawl
Imitating Bill McCall
Daddy, can I get a guitar
Because I want to be a star
The girls would say of Bill McCall
Why I bet he's over six feet tall
Handsomest man in Nashville
They said of Smiling Bill
He won't be planting potato slips
When he cashes in his chips
Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so
The station's boss said to city hall
Find Smiling Bill McCall
It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town
Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committing suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried
Turn me loose, I want to jump, he screamed
Because I can't stand that theme
Let this be my final breath
Because I'm scared to half to death
The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
Is only four feet tall
I'd rather be in the river dead
Than to hear them laughing at my bald head

43,Marion Worth,15,That's My Kind Of Love,1960,
44,Johnny Cash,16,Seasons Of My Heart,1960,"

[Verse]
The seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
Because the flowers will bloom eternally
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all
As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind

[Outro]
The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring

Hello, stranger
(Why, hello there, stranger)
Ah, could you tell me how far it is to Little Rock?
(Well no sir I couldn't, buddy, but they's a devil of a big'n down here in Pap's old field)

Hello, stranger
(Why, hello again, stranger)
Your corn looks awful little and yellow
(Ah, I planted the little yellow kind this year)
Well, you must not be figuring on much more than half a crop, are ya?
(That's exactly right, I'm raisin' on the shares, 50/50)
You couldn't be very far from a fool
(Couldn't be what?)
Very far from a fool
(That's right, son, just this microphone here between us)

Hello, stranger
(Why, hello there, stranger)
How did your potatoes turn out?
(Son, you'll have to speak a little louder, I don't hear too well out of this left ear)
I said how did your taters turn out!
(Oh, my taters. They didn't turn out a'tall, the old sow rooted them out)

Hello, stranger
(Hello, there, stranger)
Would you head that cow there for me?
(Buddy, she's got a head)
Well, turn her, then
(The hairy side's turned out)
Well, would you speak to her?

Hello, stranger

Why don't you cover your house?

Hello, stranger

How far did you say it was to Little Rock?
(Buddy, ain't you found out how far it is yet?)
I can't, I can't find out a'tall

"
46,Lonnie Irving,18,Pinball Machine,1960,"

[Spoken Intro]
This story's about an ex-truck driver bein' named John James Wall before his friends blackballed him and nick-named him Pinball. I gathered this story from a truck stop in Gallipolis, Ohio when this old feller, I'd say, 70 years old asked me to buy him a strong cup of coffee and a piece of good apple pie

I bought the coffee and the pie for the old feller and I'm awful glad I did because he winked his eye and smiled and said ""My!, My!"" Then I noticed in a few minutes, with trembling hands he pushed a part of his pie and coffee back and looked at me with tears running down his poor old weather-beaten cheek, and this is what he said...

I'm an old hog-hauler, I drove a big truck
I shot the pinball machine, but it caused me bad luck
But all I ever made in a pinball machine
I'd get four catty-corners, then I'd miss the 16
I wish they'd outlaw them old pinball machines
Many weeks they have caused me to live on sardines

Last time I called my wife on the phone
The first thing she says, ""John, when can you come home?""
""I've got a load of hogs and they've got to go
I'll see you when I get back from Chicago.""
She says, ""John, you know I love you, I wish you wouldn't go
Send your babies some money, they are hungry and cold""
The last thing she said and then she hung up
""John, you give up my lovin', just to drive an old truck""

I made my trip on to Chicago
I was gone two months, 'cause I shot up my dough
When I got home my family was gone
The best friend I had, rung my telephone
He says, ""John, I guess you wonder about your babies and wife?
Pneumonia got your babies and your wife took her life""
I lost all my friends, I can't sleep for bad dreams
I dream about an old truck and a pinball machine

[Spoken Outro]
I never will forget the last words that old man said
""Oh! Lord, if I could live my life over!"" and then he fell dead
They tell me John was a clean cut young man at the age of 19
But now he's in his grave...
A victim of a big old truck, and a pinball machine

47,George Jones,19,Accidently On Purpose,1960,"

In the papers I saw you this morning
You were lovely, dressed in your wedding gown
And it said you would marry a stranger to me
That had drifted into our old home town

Accident'ly, you met him one ev'ning
And you say it was love at first sight
Accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite

For you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly, you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite

Yes, you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown

You say you found somebody new
But that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away
Forget the love I have for you

Guess I could find somebody too
But I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret
Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave
Be sure you find
You want her love much more than mine
Then I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget

Before you leave
Be sure you find
You want her love much more than mine
Then I'll just say we've never met

Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true
Tell me darling tell me please dear is it wrong
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you

Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart
Yes the only true love I ever knew
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you
Is it wrong for loving you...
So is it wrong is it wrong for loving you

51,Claude Gray,23,Family Bible,1960,"

[Verse 1]
There's a family Bible on the table
Its pages torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories

[Verse 2]
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

[Chorus]
I can see us sitting 'round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages, cleft for me

[Verse 3]
This old world of ours is full of trouble
But this old world would also better be
If we found more Bibles on the table
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

I can see us sitting 'round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages, cleft for me

As I sit here in this old folks home
My hair just as white as snow
And I remember back when I was young again
How everything was jolly
Sister did the jig and brother beat the drum
And baby rocked her dolly, baby rocked her dolly

Well them kids of mine have all grown up
They write every now and then
As I read the letters and think memories of all our fun and folly
Sister did the jig and brother beat the drum
And baby rocked her dolly, baby rocked her dolly

That wife of mine God rest her soul
She's gone on before me
I bet she's told the Lord about all the times our house was filled with folly
Sister did the jig and brother beat the drum
And baby rocked her dolly, baby rocked her dolly

The man across the hall is a lonely man
Never had a family
So he asked me to tell him about my kids when he's feeling melancholy
Sister did the jig and brother beat the drum
And baby rocked her dolly, baby rocked her dolly

Every night I pray for them kids of mine
I wish they were here with me
But before I die Lord let me see a sight to make me jolly
Sister did the jig and brother beat the drum
And baby rocked her dolly, baby rocked her dolly
Baby rocked her dolly
Baby rocked her dolly

Wrong company
Writer Harlan Howard

I've lost the only love I've ever known
Too many nights I left her all alone
I said forgive me, one too many times
And now her parting words ___ my mind
You're with the Wrong Company they'll drag you down
You're spending too much time on the wrong side of town
Now it's your life to live, but it's my heart to give
And if you still want me, give up that wrong company
She warned me but I've wasted my last chance
And now she's gone without a backward glance
Oh how I miss the love I threw away
Every song on that jukebox seems to say

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't going to do you no good at all
Because once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

[Verse 4]
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

56,Sonny James,28,Jenny Lou,1960,"

[Verse 1]
I was put here by a jury
Of 12 good men and true
For myself, I wouldn't worry
But what about Jenny Lou

[Chorus]
What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away

[Verse 2]
Since the main street was deserted
They all believe the worst
There was only me and Jenny
Could swear it was him drew first
They believed I meant to kill him
Although he'd been my pal
There was real bad blood between us
For Jenny was once his gal

[Chorus]
What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling?
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away?

[Verse 3]
Now, they'll make my Jenny suffer
For her good name is gone
How his brother's lied by sayin'
That Jenny had led him on
They'll be comin' in the morning
To take me to a tree
Oh, when I think how they'll treat Jenny
I wish it was him killed me

[Chorus]
What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling?
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away?
What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
After I'm gone away?

57,Charlie,29,Who Will Buy The Wine,1960,"

Not long ago you held our baby's bottle
But the one you're holding now's a different kind
You just sit and wait to be somebody's baby
And it all depends on who will buy the wine
Whoever sets 'em up and tips the waitress
Your kind of love just might as well be blind
You'll never know whose lips you'll soon be kissing
And it all depends on who will buy the wine
[ fiddle - steel ]
The kind of life you're living since you've left me
I'm sure it's not the life you thought you choosed
That honky tonky world is not so flashy
Bright lights and blues is all it really knows
Whoever sets 'em up and tips the waitress...

(Hello, hello)
Hello walls (hello, hello), how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

Hello window (hello hello), well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well, look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain

She went away and left us all alone, the way she planned
Yes, we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling (hello hello), I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me awhile?

We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long time
(hello, hello)...

60,Buck Owens,2,Foolin' Around,1961,"

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

So honey fool around, you know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me

61,Patsy Cline Jim Reeves,3,I Fall To Pieces,1961,"

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces

"
62,Roy Drusky,4,Three Hearts In A Tangle,1961,"

Three hearts in a tangle one heart will have to break
Tonight as I sit by my window watching the people go by
I'm trying to reach a decision but I know I can't do what's right
Three hearts in a tangle which heart should I take
Three hearts in a tangle which heart will I break

If I choose the one that I should choose then the other heart would break
But if I'll leave them both then I'd suffer which heart will pay for my mistake
Three hearts in a tangle...

"
63,Jim Reeves,5,The Blizzard,1961,"

There's a blizard coming on, how I'm wishing I was home
For my pony's lame, and he can hardly stand
Listen to that norther sigh, if we don't get home we'll die
But, it's only seven miles to Mary Ann's
It's only seven miles to Mary Ann's

You can bet we're on her mind, for it's nearly supertime
And I'll bet there's hot bisquets in the pan
Lord, my hands feel like there froze
And there's a numbness in my toes
But, it's only five more miles to Mary Ann's
It's only five more miles to Mary Ann's

That wind's howling and it seems
Mighty like a woman's scream
And we'd best be moving faster if we can
Dan just think about that barn
With the hay so soft and warm
For it's only more miles to Mary Ann's
It's only three more miles to Mary Ann's

Dan get up you ornery cuss, or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary, but I'll help you if I can
Alright Dan, perhaps it's best, if we stop a while and rest
For it's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann's

(Sang)
It's still a hundred yards to Mary Ann's

Late that night the storm was gone
They found him there at dawn
He'd-a-made it but he just couldn't leave old Dan
Yes, they found him there on the plains
Hands froze to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards form Mary Ann's

(Sang)
He was just a hundred yards from Mary Ann's...

64,George Jones,6,The Window Up Above,1961,"

I've been living a new way
Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gath'ring
And the storm will wreck our home
For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But I guess it's best to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
--- Instrumental ---
From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love
I was wrong, I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above
How I wish I could be dreaming
And wake up to an honest love
I was wrong for I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above...

65,Marty Robbins,7,Don't Worry,1961,"

Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold

Don't pity me, 'cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed it might happen to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love, kiss me
One time then go love, I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me

Sweet, sweet, sweet, love will I want you to be
As happy as I when you love me
I'll never forget you your sweet memory it's all over now
Don't worry bout me

When one heart tells one heart, one heart goodbye
One heart is free, one heart will cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet
It's all right, don't worry 'bout me...

"
66,Ray Price,8,Heart Over Mind,1961,"

I love you so much that I can't leave you
Even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think that you still love me
And all my thoughts of leavin' do no good

You've got me, heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowin' you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Friends tell me they see you out with others
And in my heart I try hard to forget
But then you come home and tell me, you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet

You've got me, heart over mind, worried all the time
And knowin' you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

67,Johnny Horton,9,Sleepy-Eyed John,1961,"

Well a-way down yonder on the Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from my wagon seat
I fiddled my fiddle and I rubbed my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go

Sleepy-eyed John, you better your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John, better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
And try to get to heaven 'fore the Devil gets to you

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose he flopped but he couldn't get loose
Said John to the goose ""If you don't be still
We'll miss my supper down in Candyville.""

Well Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg
The little leg was nothing but a little wooden peg
One shoe off and one shoe on
He'll do the double shuffle 'til the cows come home

Now I got twenty dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since
Sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now

Well over the hickory and down the pine
The raccoon laughed and the old hound whined
John said ""Sic 'em"" and the raccoon left
They crossed Green River in a minute and a half

I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
Thought that I'd just drop by and let you know
That I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll cause you no more sorrow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
It won't replace all the heartaches I've caused you
It won't take the place of loving you, I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
Tell the kids I came by awhile last night
And I kissed them while they slept so tight
Make my cup of coffee sweet and make it warm
Just the way you used to be here in my arms
I'll have another half a cup and then I'll go

70,Buck Owens,12,Loose Talk,1961,"

So long we've been married, last burden we've carried
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up
Oh darling, what else can we do

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
Oh, I know you love me and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone

--- Instrumental ---

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling, it's not true because I still love you
And I do it all with my heart

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
Oh, I know you love me and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone

--- Instrumental ---

They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
Oh, I know you love me and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone...

There's a family Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the close of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from The Fam'ly Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
Chorus:
I can see us sittin' 'round the table
When from the family Bible Dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me
This old world of ours is full of troubles
But this world would oh, so better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me

When from the family Bible Dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing

Today I burned your old love letters I burned them slowly one by one
Before I'd light the flame I'd read them to try and find the wrongs I done
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one broke my heart in two
And all alone I left you weeping for the ashes of your letters tied in blue

As I burned your old love letters I watched my dreams go up in smoke
I lived again those precious mem'ries I heard each tender word you spoke
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one said that we were through
Our love is there among the ambers in the ashes of your letters tied in blue

You say your heart to me is closed and you no longer care
What can I say or do to make you change your mind again
Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness in
I may pretend I never cry to tell the truth I do
For sadness came with your goodbye and you're unhappy too
For if it's true you care for me to hide it is a sin
Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness in
( fiddle - steel )

And that the happy yesterday is ours to live once more
Let's live again the used to be rewards so happy then

Mental cruelty, that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty

Your Honor, since our marriage
My life's not been the same
Why, I'm missing out on all the fun
And he's the one to blame

There's never any excitement now
The way there used to be
And sharing his way of life
Is mental cruelty, mental cruelty

Divorce has been granted
For many different things
Even when there's not a reason
And when no one can be blamed

With only two little words
Why she's on her merry way
Yes, all the woman has to claim
Is mental cruelty, mental cruelty...

And the twenty-fourth hour is right about now
Right about now, the heartaches start calling
Right about now, the teardrops start falling
The late show is over and there's no place to go
And it's right about now, that I miss you you so
I start counting the hours when daylight begins
Or I know that when night comes, just how it will end
I pray that it won't come, but it comes anyhow
And the twenty-fourth hour is right about now

The first one that I ever wore
And you'd have said I looked like a dummy
Out of a dry goods store

But I don't know a thing they said
My mind kept wanderin' off down the trail
Back to the times that we've had

OKLAHOMA HILLS
Writers Woody Guthrie, Jack Guthrie

Many months have come and gone since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned many a lesson I have learned
Yet I feel like in those hills I still belong
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born
But as I sit here today many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I born
As I turn life a page to the land of the great Osage
To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows and the snow-white cotton grows
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation I rode my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born
A-way down yonder in the Indian nation a cowboy's life is my occupation

Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be

But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish

Just because I saw her then went all to pieces

I'd like to be in Charlie's shoes that's what I always said
Cause he had you and everything tied with a golden thread
Then Charlie left and went away and when I got the news
It wasn't long till I was walking round in Charlie's shoes

Now I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me

The greener grass that turned my head so swiftly did turn brown
Cause every little dream I build she's always tearing down
I never knew old Charlie's shoes could have so many tacks
Of disappointing sorrows and I wish he had 'em back

Cause I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away I've got for company

And off the isle of Olasana in the straight beyond Naru
A Jap destroyer in the night cut the 109 in two
Smoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan yeah they thought had the best of a mighty good man

And on the coast of Kolombangara looking through this telescope
Australian Evans saw the battle for the crew had little hope
Two were dead and some were wounded all were clinging to the bow
Fightin' fire and flightin' water trying to save themselves somehow
Smoke and fire upon the sea...

McMahon the Irishman was burned so badly he couldn't swim
Leave me here go on he said cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT skipper couldn't leave him a man to die alone at sea
And with a strap between his teeth he towed the Irishman through the sea
Smoke and fire upon the sea...
[ flute ]
He led his men through waters dark rocky reefs and hungry sharks
He braved the enemy's bayonets a thirty eight hung round his neck
Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on
Now who could guess who could possibly know that same man named Kennedy
Would be the leader of the nation be the one to take command
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again
Smoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy
But JFK and his crew lived on
Which proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John
(Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John)

96,Walter Brennan,8,Old Rivers,1962,"

(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go

Chorus:
He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said, Son
You know old Rivers died

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me

Chorus:
Now, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow

With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me...

97,Stonewall Jackson,9,A Wound Time Can't Erase,1962,"

Have you found since you turned me down the one that you've been searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad for you know I vowed to love you ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
And are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we were through
You've left a wound time can't erase
[ steel ]
Tell me dear are you satisfied to be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you have done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind...

Sweetheart I knew the same as you
So if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be
Then we'll wait willingly

Three days that I hate to be alive
Three days filled with tears and sorrow

There are three days I know that I'll be blue

Look who's coming down the street
Big brown eyes an' smile so sweet
Uh-oh, troubles back in town

I feel a sad old memory
Coming back to torture me
Uh-oh, troubles back in town

Funny, she still looks the same
Time has brought so little change
Why did she turn up again
Just when my heart was on the mend?

Wish I didn't love her so
Better hide until she goes
Uh-oh, troubles back in town

Funny, she still looks the same
Time has brought so little change
Why did she turn up again
Just when my heart was on the mend?

Wish I didn't love her so
Better hide until she goes
Uh-oh, troubles back in town

Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's mama no more

I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

You said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow, that I'd laugh when you walked away

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your *grip* through the door
A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

A little bitty tear let me down

Tear down your castles in the sand
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch
Get a little dirt on your hands

Get a little dirt on your hands, son
If your gonna grow up to be a big big man
A little dirt on your hands

Well I reached twenty one and I thought I was a pretty big wheel
I left the country for the city, met a slicker with a shady deal
He said hold up the bank boy and take all the money
And run as fast as you can
The only way you'll ever get along in this world
Is to get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands

Well its four in the morning' and the warden is calling' my name
He said he's teaching' me a lesson now he's making' me go work in the rain
Dig that ditch boy fill it up
I'm wanting' you to understand
The only way to straighten out a guy like you
Is to get a little dirt on your hands
Get a little dirt on your hands

Hey david got to get a little dirt on those hands boy
Yeah if you want to grow up to be a big big man
You better remember what old whispering bill told you in this song
Get a little dirt on those hands

When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
That's when I wanna see the lights of town

Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home

I've lost count of the hours and I've lost track of the days
In fact, I've lost just about everything since you went away

Everything that is except the memories you left me
And that's one things that no one can mar
I don't know who you're with, I don't even know where you've gone
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know, I wrote it especially for you
(I love you still)
And I love you wherever you are

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter and every day it burns higher
(I love you still)
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
Not even with all of these tears
My friends all think, I'm crazy and maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can
For someday you might just decide to come home
(I love you still)
And I want you to know, I'm still here

A handsome young soldier and the girl named Rosana

Oh, way down west in the winds on New Mexico
There lived a girl and the soldier who loved her so
And every night neath the full crimson moon above
This brave young soldier would pledge her his love

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

His orders came and he had to ride west again
Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again
He kissed Rosana goodbye as he rode away
Promising this time he'd come back to stay

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

That war was over and he came back home and found
That the Apaches had burned the whole village down
And neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana
Gripped on the cross was his yellow bandana

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war

He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana
Mounted his pony and rode off to war....

(Jack Clement)
Just thought I'd have a little fun and paint the town
I always said someday I'll walk the line
But now she's gone and I'm the bluest guy around
And that's not exactly what I had in mind
I thought that I could play the field and be a clown
I broke the heart that loves me anytimes
Yes, I know that I'm the biggest fool in town
And that's not exactly what I had in mind
I didn't mean for thing to get so out of hand
I always meant to make it up in kind
But now she's gone, she hate the very sight of me
And that's not exactly what I had in mind
--- Instrumental ---
I told myself, go play around you're young and free
To late I found that I was, oh so blind
I lost a love I never did deserve at all
But that's not exactly what I had in mind
No, that's not exactly what I had in mind...

YESTERDAY'S MEMORIES
Writer Hank Cochran

Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Goin' to the place where we used to park Just like always, it was still and dark But it was a little too much for my poor heart Yesterday's mem'ries tore me apart Today I walked down to that little café where we used to go And I waited for our favourite booth The one we always sat in, not too long ago But when I sat down, tears began to flow Yesterday's mem'ries won't let me go Anymore, if there's anyone around I start to cry I just say, ""Excuse me, but there's a mem'ry in my eye"" Oh my friends, things were mine, they ought to be That I was happy with new arms wrapped around me But as I lied, I cried, and they could see Yesterday's mem'ries, got hold of me

Even tho you took the sunshine out of my heaven
Even tho you took the twinkle out of my eyes
I will always be in love with you my darling even tho I sit and wonder if I'm wise

Since the day that you first told me that you love me
I have been head over heels in love with you
Now you say our little romance has to end dear
Now I walk the floor and wonder what I'll do

There was a time when in my heart I didn't doubt you
Now I'm never sure of what you say or do
For everytime time I try to I put my arms around you
Something tells me that you're not the same ole you
Even tho you took the sunshine...

For someone who loves me the way I loved you
I'm saving my lips for someone to kiss me
For someone to kiss me the way I kissed you

Time after time I've waited for your caress
Time after time I've waited in loneliness
I'm saving my dreams for someone to dream of
For someone to dream of like I dreamed of you

Time after time I've waited for your caress
Time after time I've waited in loneliness
I'm saving my love for someone who loves me
For someone who loves me the way I loved you...

I blew into Dallas feelin' kinda low thought I'd make me a bit of change at the rodeo
Heard the lineboss sayin' you on'ry cowpokes
Fifteen bales to any man who can ride Showboat (who can ride Showboat)
Showboat you old cuss I'm gonna ride you or I'll bust
Hold the reins watch the chains turn him loose that cayuse I'm gonna ride
They put me in the saddle the rein here in my hand
Then I saw her sittin' there a watchin' from the stands
She was kind of pretty a blonde with big blue eyes
I could see it hurt her so to see me have to ride (see me have to ride)
Showboat that old cuss I'm gonna ride him or I'll bust
Hold the reins watch the chains turn him loose that cayuse I'm gonna ride
He bugged me once from runnin' then he looked me in the eye
I slid down around his neck reachin' for the sky
Then he sent me flyin' like a little bird
Lord I think when I came down I ate ten pounds of dirt (ate ten pounds of dirt)
Showboat you old cuss I'm gonna ride you or I'll bust
Hold the reins ain't it a shame that cayuse done throwed me loose and broke my leg
I woke up in the General feelin' kinda hurt
Till I found that blue eyed blonde turned out to be my nurse
She fixed me up with patches and love I thought was free
Till she said now cowboy you're gonna marry me (gonna marry me)
Showboat you old cuss you done fixed me up much worse
Hold the reins ain't it a shame I'm getting married and old Showboat you're to blame
I'm getting married and old Showboat you're to blame
I'm getting married and old Showboat you're to blame

Oh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Tonight I'm burning old love letters photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better and when the smoke is gone I won't want you
Burning mem'ries teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ry burning all the memories of you that I can't lose
My heart to you no longer matters and I can't live alone with memories

And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free

Burning mem'ry burning all the memories of you that I can't lose

Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving
I won’t even turn my head
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking
I’ll be gone, like I said
You’d just say the same old things
That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I’m gone
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man
Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man

Love is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other
But love is no excuse for us to make

Sure we love each other and this could be so right
But not if someone else has got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day

It's been going on for much too long now
And our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves it's 'cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done

A reminder of my wasted years with you

What a difference this small white circle makes

One white circle tells two wjo had to part
And our love has its mark upon my heart

My eyes look like a roadmap of Georgia and it's a shame I've lost my class
One broken heart can do strange things to a fellow who can't take pain
But in this hundred proof condition I'm in no position to take her back again
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...

Looks like the hair on my head ain't never met a comb and my face is a bearded mess
My hand shakes slightly and I have to walk lightly or I'll weave from right to left
The music on the jukebox don't mean a thing cause I'm too far gone for a song
I sure feel bad cause my baby ain't here and I'm sorry that I done her wrong
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...
So pour me sorrow on the rocks...

[Verse:]
I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor, hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me 'that son of a Saginaw fisherman'
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand
Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day, I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said ""Honey, I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad, I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history""
Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said ""Son, you're wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?""
Now he's up there in Alaska, diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right, and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan

I had me a woman who couldn't be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leaning post is done left and gone

She's long gone
And now I'm lonesome blue

She told me on Sunday she was checking me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news
I got them gone but not forgotten blues
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue
I'm going to find me a river, one that's cold as ice
And when I find me that river

I'm going down in it three times, but
Lord, I'm only coming up twice

When two blue people were the victim of circumstances

Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was it charms or just the wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances

What is done is over and just a memory
The night they set a sign for you and me
Oh but the dreams this foolish heart romances

Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances

They'll all go home and I won't smile till they come back again

189,Margie,41,Understand Your Gal,1964,"

In accordance with the ""teacup generation's"" mastery of the talent of passive-aggressiveness, the following document seeks to compile such a skill into a list of meager proportions. The necessity of avoiding pointing out fault in others has resulted in a tendency for those of us among this multitude of young people to feel overly sensitive to criticism and confrontation. Some experience in these affairs is all that is required to make someone, especially of the female sex, a formidable roommate
Any of you members of the younger generation will not deny that a proper roommate cannot be mean. Allow me to elaborate, though, for any of you who remain woefully ignorant to the extreme sensitivity that has befallen our generation
You may have been told that candor is a virtue; surely, it used to be the case that you could directly converse with a roommate about any of her living habits that bothered you and it would be resolved simply by compromise. Given recent concerns regarding how others may take criticism too harshly, the telling of truth has morphed into the telling of a sort of fiction that is not full of outright lies - indirect routes that wind around the truth, but never quite reach it, play right into the sensitivities of our generation. Rather than stating something directly and facing accusations of meanness, you should, earnest student, practice the delicate tactic of concealing harmful truths in the midst of vague niceties
What I will teach you is the most abominable weapon of the ""nice"" roommate: leaving a passive-aggressive note
As fellow members of the teacup generation, I take it that you have already mastered the art of writing veiled demands. But do you know how to frame such thinly concealed commands with the language of leniency? How to sound concerned for your victim, or even how to assume compliance prior to the note's even being read? Long, flowery phrases are the best - and aptly suited for such a long-winded approach - and never address the subject directly, but rather put on the air of reminding them of something: ""Remember to clean up after you cook! Thanks!"" If you live with more than one roommate, you have the lucky advantage of also playing the altruism card, and addressing the entire group as a whole: ""Everyone would benefit if we all took out our own trash!""
But none of these tactics alone are enough for combat - the note must be presented in such a fashion, and at such a time, as is required for maximum effectiveness. The note should be written on some sort of decorative paper - preferably a small square, whether it be a sticky note or not - and the addition of extra flourishes (multiple smiley faces, exclamation marks, etc.) is not lost on the reader in adding to your demand's nice veneer. Timing and placement are equally important. No one should witness the leaving of the note, yet it must be in a place obvious to its victim. Affix it to the refrigerator with a decorative magnet as you walk out the door, or place it there when you are the last one to go to sleep
However you may choose to deploy this most vigorous weapon, know that at some point or another you will have to face your victim. Make sure your responses are tailored to her specific defensive approach
Most roommates of the ""teacup generation"" will choose to deploy much the same method as you, and, choosing not to deal with the situation in person, will dispatch one of two adversaries to exact their vengeance. The first, and by far the easiest to deal with, is the neutral friend (or other roommate, if such is the case). This friend knows both of you and wants to resolve the conflict as soon as possible, but will not take sides. She will listen to the victim and relate to you the victim's point of view. Your response should be one of understanding, but noncompliance. Insist that the victim herself will not understand your argument and will under no circumstances be willing to compromise. The mediator will not challenge you further in your stance; she also wants to avoid conflict, and usually will be the most mild-mannered of the three involved. After your ""talk"" with her is over, she will let it pass without mentioning it again - even if no result has come about
The second response of this type will manifest itself in the form of a retaliatory note, typically found with the original note in its original location. This note should be properly ignored; addressing it by either writing another or boldly challenging the victim would mean acknowledging the confrontation, which both of you are bred to avoid at all costs for fear of criticism. The risk with this strategy comes only when the victim decides to go on the offensive and brazenly ask you about it, in which case you should act like you did not see it or it was accidentally thrown out (which it should be, ""accidentally""). These lines should be delivered in a distracted manner, to show that you do not intend to speak further on the subject. Your victim, afraid of criticism and confrontation as you are yourself, will see this effrontery as a gift, rather than an offense - she will let it go to avoid saying something directly
If, however, your roommate is of a more aggressive manner - that is, she has not been cultured in the art of passivity - then a direct confrontation may result. If such is the case, appeal to her humanity by acting extremely uncomfortable: ""I'm sorry, I just feel like I have a hard time talking to people about issues,"" or, preferably, ""I've just been really stressed out lately."" If that does not work, if she seems too angry for her humanity to be your aid, then make up a reason to leave: ""I'm so sorry, I can't talk now, I have a meeting that I must attend."" If you live with other roommates as well, an additional option is to demand that the discussion be put off until everyone is present: ""They live here too, we should wait until we can all settle this together."" This tactic makes it difficult for the confrontation to ever actually take place, especially when everyone is busy and no one wants to be involved in the cold war
Of course, there is a fourth type of response, which is not put to use nearly as often due to the aforementioned increase in the desire to be as indirect as possible: the negotiator. This roommate will wait to talk to you about the note, but will not come across as confrontational. Rather, she will be of a mind to reach a compromise with you - but compromise is not your goal. Vague responses, indicating uncertainty about any of her suggestions, are best used here - and God forbid you offer any suggestions yourself. Alternatively, the tactic of leaving the situation can be deployed here as well. Being the less stubborn of the two of you, as evidenced by her willingness to negotiate, this roommate will eventually drop the subject completely, affording you a victory
Mind you, the end goal is not to come across as nice, or demanding, or anything in between. It is to avoid being placed on such a scale altogether, to rather remind your roommate of something that she already knows - instead of downright instructing or asking her to do something. In such a manner, even the best of negotiators will fall to your passivity. Try this with those of older generations (parents, for instance), and they will rue the day they thought to teach you the art of sensitivity!

190,Jean Shepard,42,Second Fiddle (To An Old Guitar),1964,"

Once we were so happy you were my very own
Then you bought that guitar and ruined our happy home
You told me that you're gonna pick you're gonna be a star
I'm tired of playin' second fiddle to an old guitar
You gaze at that guitar on your knee in a way that you never look at me
This love affair of yours has gone too far
And I'm tired of playin' second fiddle to an old guitar

You say it wouldn't be long till you'd be Number One
That we'd have lots of money and we'd have lots of fun
Well all you've done is pick and grin and sing all piece so far
I'm tired of playin' second fiddle to an old guitar
You gaze at that guitar on your knee...
I walked and preached and thought of you and tried most everything
If you keep a pickin' an old guitar and I'm a gonna sing (yodel)

191,Wanda Jackson,44,The Violet And A Rose,1964,"

A violet fell in love with a rose
And started it flashing from its head to its toe
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue

Roses are red violets are blue
I'm sending red, red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets, I'm blue as can be

I wanted my love to bouquet with you
But just like the rose you've proven untrue
A flower that's wild they say has no home
And just like the violet I'm left all alone

Roses are red

Way down in the state of Georgia among the swamps and the everglades
There's a big hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the men who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had a girl in Waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave
I caught her out Sunday morning with some guy they call Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
So I said you're gonna pay both you and Davy
Cause I'm gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
And then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones into Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me cause I guess I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave

197,Billy Walker,50,It's Lonesome,1964,"

I've walked a million miles across this floor
And a million times I’ve opened this door
But all that ever enters is the blues
Hmm it's lonesome without you

I know we just broke up two days ago
But it seems a million years or so
To get you back there's nothing I want do
Hmm it's lonesome without you

If I could count high enough I'd let you know
How many times I wished that you'd walk through that door
And love me as only you can do
Hmm it's lonesome without you

If I could count high enough I'd let you know
How many times I wished that you'd walk through that door
And love me as only you can do
Hmm it's lonesome without you

Oh love me as only you can do
Hmm it's lonesome without you

198,Jim Reeves,1,This Is It,1965,"

Well, this is it
That day is here
The day I knew would come
When you would leave me dear

Well, here I sit
While teardrops fall
And wonder why I care
When you don't care at all

But I'm a fool that way
From a-way back when
A fool who'd take you back
If you'd come back again

But, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me

Well, this is it
That day is here
It's no surprise and yet
I can't hold back the tears

Well, here I sit
And try to guess
How such an empty room
So full of loneliness

Well, even the clock has stopped
Somehow I guess it knew
That time's run out of me
It's over it's all through

Yes, this is it
You're gone, you're free
You'll find another love
But this is it for me...

199,Del Reeves,2,Girl On The Billboard,1965,"

Doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her hot pants away
I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

A doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Doggone that girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed painter said the girl wasn't real better get the (kwee) on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way
Shattered by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

What's he doing in my world?
What's he doing holding my world?
If he's not more than just friend
Why were you kissing him?

And what's he doing in my world?

What's he doing in my world?
Did you tell him that you're my girl?
If your love is really true
Tell him my world's made for two

And what's he doing in my world?

Oh, don't let me keep on wondering
Just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love
Loves somebody new

What's he doing in my world?
We don't need him in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend
Explain those kisses you gave him

And what's he doing in my world?

Lately you spent a lot of time at parties
Your head held high in a world of make believe
You don't hear a word that I tell you and I can see you no longer care for me
You don't hear a word that I'm saying may as well be talking to the ceiling
I want you to know how much I love you I talk to you all the time but you don't hear

If you'd stop for a minute and listen you would save yourself a lot of tears
Your party pals won't love you like I do I've tried to tell you but you don't hear
You don't hear a word that I'm saying...
I talk to you all the time but you don't hear

Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me

Clouds are gathering over my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye

Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds would sing
Ribbon of Darkness over me

In this cold room lying
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord, I wish I could be dying
To forget you

How I wish your old heart could see
How mine just takes and breaks all day
Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me

Come on back and take away
Ribbon of Darkness over me

The other day I walked out on the street I happened to see
A pretty young woman a little bitty boy and he looked back at me
See the big man cry mama that's what I heard him say
See the big man cry mama he looks like his heart will break

I followed them to the petshop windown the little boy stopped to see
He looked up at her said if I had a daddy he'd buy that puppy for me
See the big man cry mama...
I wanted to tell him I was his dad and he sure had a pretty mom
But the judge had said I could never see them for the things I've said and done
See the big man cry mama...

Son as you'll grow older you'll find someone who is dear
Just stick by her take care of her and you will never hear
See the big man cry mama...

All you big and burely men who roll the trucks along
Better listen you'll be thankful when you hear my song
You have really got it made if you're haulin' goods
Anyplace on earth but those Haynesville Woods
It's a stretch of road up north in Maine
That's never ever ever seen a smile
If they'd buried all them truckers lost in them woods
There'd be a tombstone every mile
Count 'em off there'd be a tombstone every mile
[ guitar ]
When you're loaded with potatoes and you're headed down
You've got to drive the woods to get to Boston town
When it's winter up in Maine better check it over twice
That Haynesville road is just a ribbon of ice
It's a stretch of road up north in Maine...
[ piano ]
When you're talking to a trucker that's been haulin' goods
Down that stretch of road in Maine they call the Haynesville Woods
He'll tell you that dying and going down below
Won't be half as bad as driving on that road of ice and snow
It's a stretch of road up north in Maine...

206,Billy Walker,9,Matamoros,1965,"

In old Mexico I stand on the square in Matamoros
Round a Plazza the couples were walking to music so sweet
I've found my love not too long ago in Matamoros
But I'm feeling low as the beggar who sits in the street
All the promises that she made me with eyes black as midnight
How could I know how fickle her promise would be
Now I'm back to find for I feel is mine in Matamoros
And there'll be bad trouble if I catch her cheating on me

Streets're narrow and dark and tequilla runs free in Matamoros
I stopped for one moment outside at Maguel's swinging doors
My heart breaks to hear the same haunting sounds of Granada
She once called it our song and vowed should be mine evermore
Then across the square went this wild young bracero I see her
Laughing and dancing and tossing her raven black hair
They'd may take a hand when I face this man from Matamoros
For the love of my woman is one thing that I'll never share

Now I walk in the night far away from the lights of Matamoros
And recall the last moments when I knew she loved me more than life
I can still hear her cry I love you and I'll prove it Manana
Then seeing my danger she jumped in front of his knife
I know the stories they'll tell in dimly casinos
Of the raven haired beauty who for her love laid dead on the floor
They'll speak of the fight with the gringo that night in Matamoros
And wonder what happened for he never returned anymore oh oh hoo

Oh, the faucet started drippin' in the kitchen
And last night your picture fell down from the wall
Today the boss said ""Sorry I can't use you anymore.""
And tonight the light bulb went out in the hall

[Chorus]
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream

Somebody threw a baseball through my window
And the arm fell off my favorite chair, again
The man called me today and said he'd haul my things away
If I didn't get my payments made by ten

Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream...

You're still the only one I'm living for
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore

(But now you're gone you're gone)

And can't quit hurtin'
Life won't ever be the way it was before

In your haste you left and said you'd be returnin'
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hoping I'll look up and you'll come walking in
For then and only then will I stop crying
And this aching breaking heart of mine will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Well I'll be happy and I live for then and only then

All that's left inside my heart is just your echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
For then and only then...
And I'll live for then and only then

Way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy like told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

I asked the jailor ""When's my time up?""
He said 'Son, we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean

Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond ring or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky Girl

[Chorus]
I swear, I love you by stars above you
How bright is it shining in your world?
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl

223,Webb Pierce,26,Loving You Then Losing You,1965,"

So used to loving you I can't believe we're through
Nobody else will do since we're apart
I tried so hard to find someone to ease my mind
But they're just not my kind so used to lovin' you

Darlin' if you ever change you may still share my name
Don't hang your head in shame forget those mistakes you've made
No one lives a perfect life so forget your foolish pride
And put your fears aside then come back to me
So used to loving you...

[Verse 1]
All the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone

[Chorus]
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

[Verse 2]
It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that could be true
Why, I should be taken out, tarred and feathered
To have let myself be taken in by you

[Chorus]
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

226,Ernest,29,Because I Cared,1965,"

The hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went to Madrid.

‘What should we drink?’ the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.
‘It’s pretty hot,’ the man said.
‘Let’s drink beer.’
‘Dos cervezas,’ the man said into the curtain.
‘Big ones?’ a woman asked from the doorway.
‘Yes. Two big ones.’

The woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the felt pads and the beer glass on the table and looked at the man and the girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry.

‘They look like white elephants,’ she said.
‘I’ve never seen one,’ the man drank his beer.
‘No, you wouldn’t have.’
‘I might have,’ the man said. ‘Just because you say I wouldn’t have doesn’t prove anything.’
The girl looked at the bead curtain. ‘They’ve painted something on it,’ she said. ‘What does it say?’
‘Anis del Toro. It’s a drink.’
‘Could we try it?’
The man called ‘Listen’ through the curtain. The woman came out from the bar.
‘Four reales.’ ‘We want two Anis del Toro.’
‘With water?’
‘Do you want it with water?’
‘I don’t know,’ the girl said. ‘Is it good with water?’
‘It’s all right.’
‘You want them with water?’ asked the woman.
‘Yes, with water.’
‘It tastes like liquorice,’ the girl said and put the glass down.
‘That’s the way with everything.’
‘Yes,’ said the girl. ‘Everything tastes of liquorice. Especially all the things you’ve waited so long for, like absinthe.’
‘Oh, cut it out.’
‘You started it,’ the girl said. ‘I was being amused. I was having a fine time.’
‘Well, let’s try and have a fine time.’
‘All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasn’t that bright?’
‘That was bright.’
‘I wanted to try this new drink. That’s all we do, isn’t it – look at things and try new drinks?’
‘I guess so.’

The girl looked across at the hills.‘They’re lovely hills,’ she said. ‘They don’t really look like white elephants. I just meant the colouring of their skin through the trees.’
‘Should we have another drink?’
‘All right.’
The warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.
‘The beer’s nice and cool,’ the man said.
‘It’s lovely,’ the girl said.
‘It’s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,’ the man said. ‘It’s not really an operation at all.’
The girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.
‘I know you wouldn’t mind it, Jig. It’s really not anything. It’s just to let the air in.’

The girl did not say anything.

‘I’ll go with you and I’ll stay with you all the time. They just let the air in and then it’s all perfectly natural.’
‘Then what will we do afterwards?’
‘We’ll be fine afterwards. Just like we were before.’
‘What makes you think so?’
‘That’s the only thing that bothers us. It’s the only thing that’s made us unhappy.’

The girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads.

‘And you think then we’ll be all right and be happy.’
‘I know we will. You don’t have to be afraid. I’ve known lots of people that have done it.’
‘So have I,’ said the girl. ‘And afterwards they were all so happy.’
‘Well,’ the man said, ‘if you don’t want to you don’t have to. I wouldn’t have you do it if you didn’t want to. But I know it’s perfectly simple.’
‘And you really want to?’
‘I think it’s the best thing to do. But I don’t want you to do it if you don’t really want to.’
‘And if I do it you’ll be happy and things will be like they were and you’ll love me?’
‘I love you now. You know I love you.’
‘I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and you’ll like it?’
‘I’ll love it. I love it now but I just can’t think about it. You know how I get when I worry.’
‘If I do it you won’t ever worry?’
‘I won’t worry about that because it’s perfectly simple.’
‘Then I’ll do it. Because I don’t care about me.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘I don’t care about me.’
‘Well, I care about you.’
‘Oh, yes. But I don’t care about me. And I’ll do it and then everything will be fine.’
‘I don’t want you to do it if you feel that way.’

The girl stood up and walked to the end of the station. Across, on the other side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro. Far away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.

‘And we could have all this,’ she said. ‘And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible.’
‘What did you say?’
‘I said we could have everything.’
‘We can have everything.’
‘No, we can’t.’
‘We can have the whole world.’
‘No, we can’t.’
‘We can go everywhere.’
‘No, we can’t. It isn’t ours any more.’
‘It’s ours.’
‘No, it isn’t. And once they take it away, you never get it back.’
‘But they haven’t taken it away.’
‘We’ll wait and see.’
‘Come on back in the shade,’ he said. ‘You mustn’t feel that way.’
‘I don’t feel any way,’ the girl said. ‘I just know things.’
‘I don’t want you to do anything that you don’t want to do -’
‘Nor that isn’t good for me,’ she said. ‘I know. Could we have another beer?’
‘All right. But you’ve got to realize – ‘
‘I realize,’ the girl said. ‘Can’t we maybe stop talking?’

They sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table.

‘You’ve got to realize,’ he said, ‘ that I don’t want you to do it if you don’t want to. I’m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means anything to you.’
‘Doesn’t it mean anything to you? We could get along.’
‘Of course it does. But I don’t want anybody but you. I don’t want anyone else. And I know it’s
perfectly simple.’
‘Yes, you know it’s perfectly simple.’
‘It’s all right for you to say that, but I do know it.’
‘Would you do something for me now?’
‘I’d do anything for you.’
‘Would you please please please please please please please stop talking?’
He did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the station. There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights.
‘But I don’t want you to,’ he said, ‘I don’t care anything about it.’
‘I’ll scream,’ the girl said.
The woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put them down on the damp felt pads. ‘The train comes in five minutes,’ she said.
‘What did she say?’ asked the girl.
‘That the train is coming in five minutes.’
The girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.
‘I’d better take the bags over to the other side of the station,’ the man said. She smiled at him.
‘All right. Then come back and we’ll finish the beer.’

He picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to the other tracks. He looked up the tracks but could not see the train. Coming back, he walked through the bar-room, where people waiting for the train were drinking. He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the people. They were all waiting reasonably for the train. He went out through the bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and smiled at him.

‘Do you feel better?’ he asked.
‘I feel fine,’ she said. ‘There’s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.’

Hey, look a-yonder comin'

Dear John oh how I hate to write dear John I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me
He handed me a letter and I was just as happy as I could be
Cause the fighting was all over and the battles have all been won
But then I opened up the letter and that started dear John
Won't you please send back my picture my husband wants it now
When I tell you who I'm wedding you won't care dear anyhow
And it hurts me so to tell ye that my love for you has gone
But tonight I wed your brother dear John

And tonight I wed another dear John

Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried, I've looked for it everywhere
It just ain't here among the rest and I'm a little upset

Yes, tell me Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance, but
It sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore

I warned her of the dangers, don't speak to strangers
If by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her

Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore

No, I don't think she loves me anymore
I don't think she loves me anymore

Our divorce has been granted
There's no more you and me
You don't care any longer what I think
You gave me so much money if I'd let you go free
And I cried all the way to the bank

For it was you that I wanted
Not your gold
It won't warm me
When the nights are dark and cold
I've got money to burn
And for that there's you to thank
But I cried all the way to the bank

Now with all of this money
You have paid me to go
Tell me where can I buy some happiness
For my heart is so heavy
That I'd sure like to know
How can something as empty wight so much

For it was you that I wanted...

237,Faron Young,41,Walk Tall,1965,"

(Walk tall)

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

All through the years that I grew up, ma taught these things to me
But I was young and foolish then and much too blind to see
I ignored the things she said as if I'd never heard
Now I see and understand the wisdom of her words

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I started goin' places where the youngsters shouldn't go
I got to know the kind of girls it's better not to know
I fell in with a bad crowd and laughed and drank with them
Through the laughter mama's words would echo now and then

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I got in trouble with the law and I'm in prison now
Through these prison bars I see things so much different now
I've got one year left to serve and when my time is done
I'll walk tall and straight and make ma proud to call me son

Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
That's what my mama told me when I was about knee high
She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye
Walk tall

He bought it for my birthday just one short year ago
This tiny blue transistor radio (radio radio)
We stayed out late and listened to the music soft and low
On the tiny blue transistor radio
And the man at the radio station made the special dedication
To Jimmy and the girl that he love so
We kissed each other gently as we listened so intently
To the tiny blue transistor radio

And now just one year later his love for me is gone
He's out tonight with his new love I know (I know I know)
And I just heard them playin' the one we called our song
On the tiny blue transistor radio
And the man at the radio station made the special dedication
To Jimmy and the girl that he love so
Her happy eyes are glisnin' while my sad heart is listenin'
To the tiny blue transistor radio my tiny blue transistor radio

He couldn't move a mountain
Nor pull down a big old tree-ee
But my daddy became a mighty big man
With a simple philosophy

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Sometimes he'd kiss my mother
And hold her tenderly-why
Then he'd look across the top of her head
Then he'd wink and say to me

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Well he was a man of laughter
But a tragedy came by-why
The tears ran free and he'd say to me
Never be afraid to cry

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Today I still remember
Just like yesterday-ay
'Bout a mighty big man with a mighty big heart
And a mighty few words to say

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well
Do what you do do well...

I'll get a maid someday but till then I'm queen of the house
No time to fix my hair need a new dress to wear
Old clothes will have to do cause the kids all need new shoes
I got bridge club each Tuesday night he goes out with the boys and gets tight
But when the evenin's through he comes a home to the queen of the house
I know the milkman the iceman they come every day
They give me tips on the horses to play
And when I got the time to spare I sit and wish that I'd picked a rich millionare
I sing up every day at six bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four pretty soon there'll be one more
Oh by Syndays I'm mighty glad we send the kids to his Mom and Dad

Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go
Oh! lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose

Now my pappy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of an engineer
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

Thank you!

Oh, yes!
Oh, yes, my little salmon headed friend!
OK. Good night! Thank you very much!
Thank you for the standing ovations! We had the orgasm up front.
Let's have a cigarette, let's relax.
We are here in New York, fucking New York!
Yes!
Obviously this is not gonna be a normal night of theater!
This will be Shakespeare with a strap on!
So that's the way you like it!
Welcome to my beautiful set from the musical ""Fantastic Voyage""!
Or maybe the last thing a clitoris sees!
I'm over here!
I'm down here!
This is brought to you by HBO, a subsidiary of Time Warner,

You've got mail. I hope you don't have stocks!
Welcome!
Don't be afraid!
It was very reassuring the other day...
George W. Bush talked to the stock market and...
Him talking about business ethics
it's like having a leper giving you a facial.
It doesn't really work !
""A lot of our imports come from other countries"".
No shit, Jason?!
Moving right along...
Meanwhile, Michael is protesting...
I don't know, baby...
It was strange enough when Michael was the best man at Lisa's wedding.
That for me was like you're pushing the term, my man!
That was a pretty short list. Was Richard Simmons hunting?
- What are you doing? - I'm the best man!
Now Michael is claiming racism.
Honey, you gotta pick a race first.
What are you claiming there? Mistreatment of elves?
Girl, you gotta pick a gender, too. What are you going for?
You were Diana Ross. Now you just left it all behind.
Michael, you're not a freak. You're just surgically enhanced...
and you spend more money than the Vatican.
If you go to Neverland, it says:
""You must be this high to ride Michael""
Obviously, the lawyers at HBO are going, ""Fuck!""
How fucked up would you have to be

Thank you!
We were worried about the pledge of the legions.
We're gonna say: ""One nation under dog!""
It's OK.
And now people are going: ""I've got a cure for this!""
One nation under Canada, above Mexico.

NY police have a catch and release program. Way to go!
Stop! OK, go on again!
You there! Get the fuck outta here!
I like NY on a day like today. For a while everything went like you're OK.
People like to great new Yorkers: ""Have a nice day, asshole!""
Fuck you, my friend! Enjoy your day!
But the most beautiful thing about a day like today in NY is
that the ladies take the twins for a walk!
Oh, yeah, the titties are out today!
On a hot day all the titties are out there. And God made them go like...
Beautiful titties, all shapes, sizes and women running they are going...
And then they hit a breeze and chicken's done!
Yeah, baby!
These are not like the tits in Vegas,
where even God goes: ""I didn't make those!""
Fake tits are like Nazis.
They don't laugh, they don't dance, they're just...
I'm walking here!
I've seen a woman turn and the tits stayed there.
It's like they don't have any teeth because they knock them out.
I've seen tits that are really bad
with the nipples on the top. They look like Kilroy.
When you go up Madison Avenue you see some hardcore surgery like...
I'm so scared, but I can't express it.
These ladies had so much surgery are going:
""What are these lumps under my eyes?""
Those are your tits, madam!
- And what's this? - Don't ask, Mrs. Trotski!
This is good news for you.
And girls getting botox injections...?
- Look, I don't have any wrinkles. - You also have no expression.
You look like you've had a slight coma, but you're beautiful.
One guy say to you: ""Baby, I want you to get your tits done for me!""
Do it for me. Do it for your daddy man.
And you say: ""OK, daddy man!""
Than I want you to get your balls done for me, OK ?
I want you to get those big old basket balls.
So when you do the Baywatch thingy, it's like...
Nothing drives a woman crazy like a big old Easter basket on her bunny.
You go to the doctor...
Girls...
Payback's a bitch ! Go for it, girls !
'Cause you went through a hard time. This whole winter was so bizarre.
Temperatures were like
. It was fucking weird!
The weathermen are going:
""I don't fucking know what's going on!""
Let's just see what happens.
Flowers were like Anne Heche going: ""I'm out, I'm in, I'm out...""
I don't know when to go.
George came back from Japan and went: ""I went to the Coyote Conference""
- No, it's Kyoto. - That's a very good car.
George, walk away.
They say there's no global warming.
But right now the North Pole is a pool.
It is beyond global warming. At this point is cooking.
At
in the middle of the country: ""Is it hot enough for you?""
No, I like sweat to be rolling down the crack of my ass like Niagara.
I like my old man's titties to lactate, my man.
You see people in shorts and you're going: ""Please, don't wear those!""
Please, don't put those on!
If you go to South West Airline:
""You're not fat, you're horizontally challenged""
Big people at South West Airlines have buy two seats.
The problem is that they are not together.
And you have to put your tits in the overhead rack.
People don't mind now. We're working our way through.
All over the country we've got weird things.
In Houston they got Enron field.
We're gonna call it  fifth Amendment for you.
We can't call it: ""We're fucked for you!""
Arthur Anderson put in the chairs that spin both ways.
And now Martha Stuart may become somebody's bitch.
No!
Say it ain't so!
I like to consider it more like ""severed companion"".
If you only have one room, and I like to call it my ""private space,""
use the light well. You have vertical bars, don't use horizontal blinds.
Also, think of your ankle bracelet as an accessory.
The first time she has lunch going: ""You call this quash?""
Shut up, bitch! You're inside now, you're mine!
All over things have been going good. I've been to Memphis, to Graceland.
I never knew that Ray Charles had a decorating license.
They're some severe...
They're colors there that have never seen daylight.
I've been to Nashville, I've heard people sing songs like:
""Take your finger outta my ass, 'cause I'm leaving you behind!""
Weird shit people do now. I'm sweating like crazy up here.
It's HBO, 'cause it's live.
People playing baseball. You've got a good seat.
Yankees are kicking the game, way to go!
They did a good job. They came through.
Everybody's worried about people playing baseball on steroids.
Here's one quick way you tell:
on steroids, your balls shrink and your head grows.
So if someone steps up to the plate
with a Mardi Gras head and Raisinettes, you're out!
Poor Barry Bonds! They won't pitch to him
and when they do it, they're trying to kill him.
He's like Yasser Arafat of baseball.
For Jerusalem I have an interesting plan.
It's called a timeshare, like Miami, let's try that.
Jews will get Hanukkah and Passover,
Christians will get Christmas and Easter
and Muslims will have Ramadan and the other holiday, Kaboom.
Obviously, the people of HBO are going ""Oh, fuck off.
What are you doing, you asshole.""
I'm very excited because this is my time
when I was watching World Cup Soccer, my man.
I saw world cup, baby.
There's a few soccer fans, the rest of you are going:
""Uh, that's like football without pads, right?""
For the rest of the world, it's football.
For us, it's ""A strange sport, played by damaged people.""
We made it in the World Cup. Everyone plays it.
Not like the World Series, 'cause the French don't have a baseball team.
If they did, they would only have left field and no one would be safe.
You know what I'm saying?
What can you do, huh? It is Bastille day, alore.
The day that Marie Antoinette gave the ultimate head. Look out!
We are French. Fuck you, Americans, I don't care!
My friend Lance Armstrong is racing right now in The Tour du France.
And every year the French go, ""He is on chemicals.""
""It's chemotherapy, you little toad suckers.""
Okay, he has one testicle, he's aerodynamic.
Everyone, cut off your balls. You'll be quicker.
Do it. Don't be afraid.""
When you look at the World Cup, America finally made it.
We made it to the sixteenth, baby!
We're no longer in the ""Special Olympics"" category.
They used to see us coming: ""Give it to them, they're damaged people""!
Thank you for the ball. I got a ball. I kick the ball!
Unlike the Brazilians. When they play is like...
And the fans...
Brazilians are going: ""Look, I'm playing soccer...
Look, I'm scoring!
And now I'm kicking the ball.""
Soccer is kinda mellow, you know. Is a little passive aggressive though.
I didn't do anything... What are you looking at?
It's not like hockey, when someone comes up with a stick and goes:
""Bang, mother fucker!""
That's why there are no Spanish hockey players.
When a white guy takes a stick and goes...
""Motherfucker, I'm going to cut you off now!""
And you, Freddie Krugger bitch, take off the mask, mother fucker!
Coming in there! Katami!
Sometimes guys do this weird thing... They fall down and pretend like...
I've been killed... I've been blinded...
There's nobody near me, huh? OK, I'm kidding!
And the referee comes over: ""Yellow card!""
Two yellow cards. ""Red card!""
Three cards. ""Green card!""
And the referee is so sweet, too.
""What's your name? Turn around.
Why didn't you call me after the Mexico game ?
Not like football referees: ""Too much commercial time""
Mad white man dancing on the field.
Moving away. Moving away.
In the World Cup they always claim there's bad refereeing,
someone may have been paid off.
Oh, shit, say it ain't so!
You're telling me that the Oscars are also political? Fuck off!
There's a game mafia!
The mob's hand!
Fairy Godfather: ""Does this pistol make my ass look big?""
If you go to LA, there's a great greeting these people do: ""Love ya!""
""Love you!"" ""Hey, love you!""
The worst referee was in Winter Olympics with a French judge.
Once again, the French fucked with us!
The Canadians skate perfectly. ""We did it perfect, huh!""
And then the Russians they come and fuck up
and the French judge: ""They fucked up, I give it to them""
At that point I'm going: ""Where's Tonya Harding when you need her?""
Tonya would've been on that judge like shit on Velcro.
""Give me that medal, you French whore!""
""I won!""
Now we get to see Tanya Harding fight Paula Jones
in an all white trash weekend.
Trailer park Tuesday!
Tonya went right for the nose: ""Not the nose. That's the Clinton money!""
Next is gonna be Joey Butafuoco fighting John Wayne Bobbit.
There will be no hitting bellow the belt there, my friend.
Fuck, man, give it back! My balls are in the front row.
What's next? The Nixon's daughters belt for the library money.
Be there as my bitches go at it.
At this point, even Caligula is going:
""What the fuck are you people doing?""
Why don't you have Hannibal Lector and Iron chef
just kick out the jams?
'Cause you got the chamber, the chair, fear factor.
People in Texas are going ""We got those shows.
We just don't film them.""
Two weeks ago, Supreme Court banned the execution of retarded people.
People in Texas are going, ""Shit, where's the fun in that?""
'Cause they were zapping retarded people every other week.
It was like, ""Go sit on Santa's lap, Timmy.""
And I know the definition of ""retarded"" in Texas is pretty wide.
It's crazy!
Even a Taliban is going: ""You are crazy mother fuckers!""
There was a guy with one leg. They wouldn't gonna give him a wooden leg.
He's gonna be dead man hopping.
There's a moment of compassion. Before the lethal injection,
they do an alcohol swab. Which is so nice!
What the fuck are you doing?
We don't want you to get that last second infection!
It's all safe now.
You remember the Winter Olympics. They had them in Utah. Great place!
What, was Amish country booked, what happened?
Common down to Salt Lake! We're gonna party like it's
.
Bring your wives. Oops! Come on down!
At the closing ceremony they introduced
Donnie and Marie, as the first couple of Utah.
I went: ""Aha, honey, no! They're only a couple in Arkansas.
If you're going to Georgia, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda broke up.
Jane found God and Ted found out it wasn't him.
About the Olympics once again,
we're talking about the figure skating.
I find the figure skating to be kinda sexy.
Not ice dancing, which is polka on Valium. That's not good.
That's that pair figure skating. There's one very special lift.
Where the male skater goes...
Right here!
Where even a gynecologist would go: ""Put on a glove, man!""
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
And I'm going: ""Let's cut the foreplay,
let's have ice fucking, come on!""
Nipples aroused...
And she holds on without her hands!
Even the French judge would go: ""I like it!""
""I don't care. I'm giving them the medal. Fuck the Canadians!""
""So fabulous!""
There's other kinda sexual thing in the Olympics: the luge,
about which I have only one question:
what drunken, German gynecologist invented this sport?
What guy went, ""I want to dress like a sperm,
shove an ice skate in my ass,
and go balls first down an ice chute.
Ya. That would be fun.""
No! This is for pussies!
- How will you stir? - I will do Kegels!
I will flex my ass and go down the aisle.
And do not talk to me about two men luge.
I'm saying ""Boys, get a room!""
Make that turn, you bastard, make it.
Hard right, you fucker, hard right!
Pour guy gets to the end of the run: ""I got wood, man, I'm sorry!""
You cost us the race!
Your penis going brr was
of a second winds resistance!
We could've won if you weren't going brrring!
Dolphin boy!
There's always some horrible drug scandal.
This year was a Spanish cross-country skilor...
Skilor, which is like a skier.
- Are you a skilor? - Yes!
They accused him of taking some performance enhancing drug.
Like an elephant growth hormone.
Are you on some sort of drug?
Are you taking an animal tranquilizer?
And they didn't bother drug-testing the snowboarders.
Go, go my little boys, have fun!
I guess they realized the word ""half pipe"" meant something.
Remember the kid who won the gold medal?
He was in freestyle.
- You wanna be on a box of Wheaties? - No. Count Dracula.
Aha, a clue, Sherlock!
The poor Canadian snowboarder, in
Olympics,
they took away his medal because he tested positive for marijuana,
which is kinda redundant number one.
Number two, they said that marijuana was a ""performance-enhancing drug"".
Marijuana enhances many things, colors, tastes, sensations,
but you are certainly not fucking empowered.
When you're stoned, you're lucky if you can find your own goddamn feet.
The only way it's a performance-enhancing drug is
if there's a big fucking Hershey bar at the end of the run.
Then you'll be like...
Then you'll be like a Swiss ski jumper going, ""I'm there!""
Pour Canadian snowboarder. They asked for his medal back
and he couldn't find it. It was around his fucking neck!
Get out of here, you little goofy Canadian bastard, eh.
They have weird sports like the Biathalon
which is like Norwegian Drive-By.
Get the TV, Hans!
The Canadians won the gold medal in hockey.
God bless you Canadian people.
You're so fucking nice eh.
It's your only fucking sport, come on!
That and a mutant form of football.
""We've got    men, we have a longer field""
You have fun, enjoy!
Canada's like a loft apartment over a really great party.
Keep it down, eh!
We are nice. We have Jean Chrétien, our great prime minister.
He was the only man in the world: ""I don't need no secret service""
""If a guy comes to hit me, I fucking knock him out eh.""
""I'm Jean Chrétien. First was your president, who's a cretin"".
Quebec is going to break away from Canada, but still keep the currency.
It's like a kid moving out of the house,
""but I still would like to get money"". Fuck off you!
Canadian money is also called ""the Looney"".
How can you take an economic crisis seriously?
- The Looney is down! - Oh, how sad for you!
What are you saying, eh?
Everyone was so happy that at the Olympics the security was so tight.
Security was amazing at the Olympics.
You chose the whitest fucking State in the Union!
An Arab in Utah is like an albino at the Apollo. You would notice!
- I found one! - It's just Ted. Everybody out!
The problem was that there was basically white powder everywhere.
All the dogs looking for Anthrax were going:
""You go, man, you go!""
Pour dogs they looked for Anthrax and cocaine.
In the cage at the end of the day they're going:
""I can't taste my ass, I don't know why?""
""It's my tail!""
Meanwhile your cat sits over there going:
""You're still an asshole, you know that"".
Is it me, or are cat's drag queens?
The way they kinda go: 'Who loves Kitty?'
""Are these your shoes?""
Who loves Kitty? Who loves Kitty?
Male cats have an amazing thing,
kinda walk around going: ""That's mine!""
""Mine!""
""I like that too.""
Thank God men aren't like that!
""Nice car, Bob. Mine now!""
- What are you doing? - Just shopping!
The whole Anthrax thing had people going...
They said: ""Don't open your mail!""
- Why? - There's white powder in envelopes.
Really?!
Your mother and I used to look for white powder in envelopes.
We weren't on-line. We did lines, my friend.
And there were ninjas on the fucking line, trying to kill us.
And now, there are people trying to kill us.
And that's why I bought a gas mask.
I can't even get a condom on when I want to!
""Hey, baby. Yeah, I got a love glove. Hold on.""
""I'll be right with you, honey.""
""Don't go away on me now.""
You're playing ""Beat the cock"".
""I got it, I got it!""
There's your penis like a midget in a diving suit...
""I don't think we're going in today, Pete.
We didn't make the deadline.""
Remember when they sent Anthrax to Tom Daschle's office?
And they cleared that fucking place out.
Everybody out, come on! Helmets, suits, they're all leaving.
And when the Congressman walked out they go:
""But the rest of you, go about your lives.""
""Everything is perfectly OK.""
""We'll be miles away.""
It's like when you go to the dentist and he puts a shit over your balls.
He walks behind concrete, going: ""You'll be fine!""
How can you tell if Congress was sick?
It's night of the living dead anyway.
All those old senators going:
""The confederate flag is just the symbol of states' rights.""
Yeah, and the swastika is just a good luck charm.
When did Ted Kennedy become Jabba the Hutt?
He's huge!
You're a Kennedy, not a Maisy's day float, come on!
Bring him down. We're voting!
Step away, boy. I said ""no"" to the Crispy Cream.
Congress recently approved the covert plan
to assassinate Saddam Hussein.
So what they've done, is PUBLICLY approve
the secret plan to assassinate Hussein.
I wonder if he knows?
I know there's a cure for bio terrorism or whatever it is.
And it lies within Keith Richards, I know that.
He is the only man on the planet
who can go: ""Anthrax? All right...""
Doesn't go with my E. cola, but fuck...!
Keith is the only man who can make the Osbornes look fucking Amish.
I've seen him going to a drug dealer who said: ""I'm out, man!""
""I have nothing left.""
Supposedly he goes to Switzerland and changes his blood.
Not like one pike, but like a fucking Chevrolette, all of it.
I just wanna know who gets his blood?
Some old Swiss man going:
""You've gotta go on tour, bitch!""
""We gotta pay for mixed babies.""
We may all be dead and gone,
Keith will still be there with five cockroaches.
He'll be going, ""I smoked your uncle, did you know that?
Fucking crazy...""
Every so often, Rumsfeld comes out and goes,
""I don't know where. I don't know when.
But something awful's going to happen.
Thank you, that's all for today, no further questions.""
Excuse me, can you give me a clue?
What is it, the Central ""Intuitive"" Agency now?
Are you working with Miss Cleo?
I don't know where, I don't know when,
but sometin' awful's gonna happen!
And definitely don't marry that fat man.
He only wants you for your money, girl!
People are suing Miss Cleo for fraud. I went: ""Fucking da!""
What do you want? A blind tarot card before you go, ""Ah ha!""
If she's a psychic, why does she need a fuckin' phone number?
Number two, that fake Jamaican accent?
If she was a real psychic,
she'd be one of those Louisiana psychics, like, ""You gonna die!""
They have to puck your ass up
and have a place for your bike, come on now!
It's like buying hair care products from Cher.
She's wearing a wig, you idiot!
Take that abdominal thing helping you lose weight
while it shocks your fat ass sitting watching TV.
I'm getting six-pack-abs by knocking my testicles around!
You strap that to your head.
And say, ""I will not buy stupid shit for no reason!""
Now we are in troubled times.
When it happened, I thought the Statue of Liberty would change.
Instead of ""Give me your tired and your poor,""
it would be her with a baseball bat going ""You want a piece of me.""
There was hardcore security. In NY stopping people in the tunnel..
In Washington they had F-  s flying, air cover everywhere.
In San Francisco, not so hardcore security.
At Golden Gate Bridge there's a Hummer and I'm talking about the car.
One Hummer here, two Guardsmen, same at the other end of the bridge.
The problem is that the Hummer and the Guardsmen
are in jungle camouflage.
For those who never been to SF, the bridge is bright orange.
So I feel like going: ""Be vewy, vewy quiet.
We're wooking for tewwowists.""
Airport security, before all this happened it was:
""Beep, OK, get on the plane, come on.""
""What's that? Oh, that's a gun. OK, get on the plane.""
You could carry a four inch blade, that's about that long.
Now, you can't even take a nail-clipper on a plane.
What, are they afraid you're gonna go ""All right!
Give me the plane or the bitch loses a cuticle.
I have a nail file. I can be irritating.""
And if you have a steak or a piece of meat, they won't give you a knife.
It's like the quest for fire flight.
""Sir, you're making a lot of noise.""
The Hindu man in the back is going: ""Hold the bowl higher"".
""Don't be afraid to beg, use your hands.""
Now the airport security is tight. You go through the metal detector
and if you are heavily pierced, like some of my friends:
""Take out your keys, sir.""
""Tip of the iceberg.""
For those playing the home game, this is called a Prince Albert.
I'm sure that was his last wish.
I'm sure Albert said, ""Victoria, I'm dying.
I want you to name a museum, a performance hall
and a bolt through the cock after me.""
""That will be Victoria's Secret. Go, my darling.""
""Say a little song to people that have little anal floss.""
And I'm talking heavily pierced.
Not like Britney Spears: ""I'm a virgin!""
Yeah and Michael Jackson is the father. Move on!
I'm talking like a hoop through your nipple.
You know, lady.. I'm guessing!
Just the kind when your clothes are going...
When you have a big hoop, what you're gonna do? Tie up a pony? No!
Or you have two. He's and hers towels, whatever you want!
A towel down here, so you can wash up. Fun!
It's interesting when you see a girl with a bolt through her tongue.
Why did you do that?
To enahthe the thekthual thtimulathon.
""Nothing drives my boyfriend crazy
like the feel of cold steel on his hot rock.""
""But the problem is I ended up knocking out all my teeth
and living in a trailer park with a man named Bubba.""
That's the trade-off, my darling.
You get a tattoo with a barb wire at
and by the time you're    it's fucking picket fence.
And Madonna turns into Mother Hamilton.
""I'm dying, melting.""
Here's what you wanna do.
When I was growing up I didn't have Playboy or Penthouse. Sad for me!
But I had National Geographic
and the girls that got me crazy...
You know the ones with the slinky neck going...
Do that, drive your parents crazy going down the stairs...
Or do the full ubangy go:
""Mom, dad, it's also a CD-player"".
And you can take out the plate and jump with your lower lip.
Have fun!
Watch grandma go: ""Shit!""
Union guys going: ""Don't touch it, Mr Williams!""
This shit is gonna be more precious than oil.
Ten years from now, it's already started to happen. People going:
""I got water.
And if you want it cold, I got ice, mother fucker.""
Going on the planes now, a sweet little Southern stewardess going:
""Ladies and gentlemen, before we board flight five,
we're just gonna do a few random bag checks.""
""These are totally random.""
""I'm just gonna read of a few names:""
""Has'N'T'Been' Seen,
Akeem Been'Laid,
Have'N'T'Been Fucked,
Judy Smith?
arabs and a blonde?
And every black and Hispanic man in the room is going: ""Thank you, God!""
""Oh, yes, we're off the list, mother fucker, yeah!""
""They're gonna be fucking with you now, Habib.""
""You better learn to go orderly.""
They take the knitting needles from the eighty-year-old lady,
'Why, cause I'm gonna knit an Afghan?' Give 'em to me!
And they're patting a five year old boy down, and he's going,
'What are you doing? You're not a priest, let go of me!'
I see! You've had a problem too, I guess.
Father pats little boys down, like,
'Good game, boy, good game! Wash up, really wash up!'
They caught them, but they had a divine witness protection program.
Find the priest, here's the pity fall,
here's the priest, find the pity fall.
Don't you ask, don't you tell, You might end up right in Hell.
Here's your check, direct from Rome, buy yourself a brand new home.
Isn't that amazing ? The Pope...
Applause break number two.
It was amazing when the Pope gathered the cardinals in Rome and went...
The only problem is that he's dressed like Liberace stunt double.
I have a solution, though !
For problem priests, a little shock collar, going near a kid it's like:
'You know, Timmy...
Tommy, I think... !
Or the automated confessional, could be fun.
'If this is a venal sin, press one.
If this is a carnal sin, press two.
If this is cardinal law, please stay on the line.'
Cause you have to remember, it's not just a sin, it's a felony!
So we have to keep track!
Right now they're up there watching. ""Hi, Mr Edgecroft.""
We're now under the offices of Homeland Security.
Tom Ridge ever so often goes: ""Today is a blue day."" ""No, orange"" ""Red"".
They had to be very careful picking that name: ""Homeland Security"".
They couldn't say Fatherland because a lot of the old Germans are going:
""That's a good one!""
But Homeland sounds like Homefront Security,
which was England during WWII.
Old men with pitchforks and colostomy bags, defending England!
There they were, Rudolph has personally:
""I threw my colostomy bag, covered him in shite
and said 'Get off of that fucker, you fucker, get out'""
And I also find out now, that Winston Churchill,
one of the greatest orators of all time,
may have been so fucked up on cognac and champagne,
that he didn't do some of his great speeches.
They were done by a man from the BBC, who also did ""Winnie the Pooh"".
will fight them on the beaches, in the air, on the land!
Eeyore and Tigger!'
And, he was fighting against Hitler!
A man who a book recently declared was a homosexual,
and I always thought this was a clue!
That and the leather and the dancing!
We are now finding ourselves once again drown to England
during these troubled times.
Tony Blair, a militant liberal.
Here, George W Bush, compassionate conservative.
This sounds like a Volvo with a gun rack, but...
Here, Tony Blair, a man who addressed the House of Common,
which is like Congress, with a two drink minimum, crazy place!
- I believe my worthy opponent... - Fuck off!
oh bollocks you, bastard. Fuck you!
Would someone remove Ms Thatcher from the chamber?
Tony said: ""This heinous incident has brought us
to the edge of oblivion...""
""But our civilization shall endure!""
And there's poor W going: ""Shit, I can't even spell that.""
'Cause you look at Bush and you realize it's Bush  . .
It's a piner release. It came with certain bugs in the software.
""This country will not be taken hostile,
oops, delete, delete, hostage.""
And you look at him and realize he has a short attention span.
""Our economy is going... oh, look at the kitty"".
He kinda reminds me of a guy in college with a towel going... gotcha!
You just don't want him to drive.
Some men are born great, some achieve greatness,
some get it as a graduation gift. It's OK!
Historically...
You must look at it from a historical perspective.
He's George the second. The boy-king.
A man we thought could only loose, but somehow won,
because of confused Hebrews. Yes!
W doesn't speak while Chaney's drinking water. Check it out!
When everything went down,
they put W out there, but they protected Chaney.
Chaney had an angioplasty. Most people wait till it heals.
He was like: ""I'm perfectly fine!""
""I'm OK!""
And there's Ashcroft in the back: ""Work your arms, you asshole!""
You have to remember, John Ashcroft is a man
who lost to a dead man in Missouri.
Choices in Missouri were: John Ashcroft - Dead Man.
And people in Missouri went:
""I'm sorry, John, but the dead man scares me less than you do.""
Here's the drill for me. You know what's strange?
It doesn't scare me that W. waved at Stevie Wonder.
That's OK.
Stevie's only been blind since birth!
And there's W. going: ""Stevie !""
Even Stevie Wonder's going, ""Is that mother fucker waving at me?
Does he think I'm looking for him? Goddamn!""
No! What scares me
is that W almost died from a fucking pretzel.
We have billions of dollars in national defense.
They want billions more for national security.
And he almost fucking goes down from snack food!
Secret Service is going: ""Games over, man!""
""Gilligan's down. Gilligan's down.""
""Step away from the chip, sir!""
We have to have people go: ""Hydrate, you bastard!""
His own dogs didn't give a shit. They were licking him for the salt.
You need a dog that cares. A dog like Lassie.
""What's wrong, Lassie? The President swallowed something
and you did the Heimlich?""
""What else, girl?""
""Mr Chaney is meeting with the Enron people?""
""An Enron employee is secretary of the Navy?""
""What about the Harken loan?""
""Sorry, girl, we gonna have to put you down.""
Oh, Kenny Boy. The Feds, the Feds are coming.
Welcome, boys and girls, to Disney's new ride.
Investment pirates of the Caribbean.
Your money checks in, it doesn't check out.
Sometimes you catch George unprepared and he says unusual things.
- Mr Bush, what are we gonna do? - We're gonna conduct a crusade.
And everybody in the room went...
All throughout the Middle East...
Hide the women and children and the number zero, they're coming!
And you can't bomb the Afghanis back to the stone age
because they'll go: ""Upgrade. Fun!""
Today's bombing raid has enlarged the hole from yesterday's bombing raid.
We have moved trouble from here, to here.
In the upper right corner, possible member of the Talibans,
or ""concubine"", we're not sure.
We did fire the
million dollars cruise missile and we're successful.
Operation ""Extreme Redundancy"" is carrying on!
Then we dropped bombs, food, food, bombs.
And here's the fun part:
some of the bombs were little yellow bombs...
and the food packages were little yellow packages.
So now you're playing ""Survivor: The Real Game.""
""I was here yesterday... I'm gonna go for this one today...""
And what was in those packages?
Pop-Tarts, peanut butter,
all you need is a honey-baked ham and you'll have a Redneck Christmas.
Who dropped the honey-baked ham on the Muslims?
Why are we dropping Pop-Tarts and peanut butter on Afghanistan?
Number one: it taste a shit load better than dirt.
Number two and more importantly:
It's very difficult to have a call to Jihad
with a mouth full of peanut butter.
Secondly... or thirdly, for those keeping track...
Afghanistan is a hashish smoking culture.
And everyone who's ever been a friend of the Hooka will go:
""Pop-Tarts!""
Yes! Got milk?
We're trying to win hearts and minds. How do we do that?
We build an amusement park ""Muslim Mountain"" with Gadafi ducks? No!
Do we have a wet burger contest? No!
Do we play Cat Stevens' records all day? ""Fuck off!""
Drop Martha Stuart's tits? No!
Do we have a children show called ""Saudi Dudi""? No!
What we must do is go the way you gotta get a sister. You know?
You gotta get a sister from Brooklyn.
You know what I mean, aha, girl? You know what I'm sayin'?
One of those bitches you see on Jerry Springer.
Drop her ass in Kabul, she'll go:
""Girl, you don't have to dress like a mother fucking beekeeper!""
""You don't have to be Casper's bitch, forget all that!""
If he picks up a rock, 'cause you're talking to another man,
you pick a bigger rock and say: ""Hit the fan, mother fucker!""
He tries to cut off your clitoris, make you a Barbie doll,
you grab a knife and say: ""Lorena Bobbit time!""
""Don't make me, 'cause I'll go Oprah on your ass. Don't make me!""
We're dealing with fundamentalists...
Amish are fundamentalists, but they don't try
and hijack a carriage at needlepoint.
And, if you're ever in Amish country and you see a man
with his hand buried in a horse's ass, that's a mechanic.
Who are we looking for?
Osama Bin Laden, one of    children.
Even Freud would say: ""He has issues.""
What does he look like without the beard?
Howard Stern, Barbra Streisand? I don't know, I don't care!
I know this: he's a six foot five Arab on dialysis...
Why is that so fucking hard to find?
Look for somebody attached to their luggage.
I also know this. When you see the tapes of him, you see a psychopath.
Wait a minute. We have some of our own!
Theodor Kasinsky, sitting around with nothing to do.
Ted's played ""A Beautiful Mind"", the home game.
You give Ted a mailing list and some tools...
Ted, these people have been bad.
- Are they bad? - Very bad!
- I just want a few things. - I know you do!
Or we get Charles Manson. Great organizer, incredible with chicks.
You can't use him.
Chucky all the time comes out for parole
with a swastika on his forehead.
- I'm better. - In many ways, yeah.
- What would you do if you got out? - I'd kill everybody.
What are we dealing with?
One of the fundamental things is in a Jihad.
Sounds like a country western term like Jeeha.
And if you are in a Jihad and you kill an infidel
which, I'm sad to say, is all of us
and you yourself die...
you go to heaven and you are greeted
by    dark-haired virgins.
Now everyone who's ever been with one virgin is going...
""I don't know...""
""For my talent portion...""
Recently, there was a article in the New York Times,
a Koran scholar said:
""The actual translation is not    dark-haired virgins,
but    crystal clear raisins.""
Slight difference in interpretation, really.
It's like instead of ""Thy shall not kill"" is ""Thy shall not wear a kilt"".
And the Scottish are going: ""Fuck off!""
Imagine some guy blows himself up, goes to the gates of Heaven:
- Where are my bitches? - Here are your raisins.
Or    Virgils going: ""You got a pretty face!""
Osama Bin Laden goes to the gates of Heaven,
there's George Washington going:
""How dare you defy that what we created""
and gets violent on his ass.
other members of the Congress start kicking the shit outta him.
Osama: ""Where are the virgins?""
""   Virginians, you asshole!""
""I must talk to Jesus Christ!""
""Where is Jesus Christ?""
And Saint Peter goes: ""Hey, Jesus, did you call a cab?""
I heard it. Finally the PC's.
We crossed the politically correct line.
It's OK to beat the shit out of them, but don't do the Ethnic jokes.
How Buddhist of you!
Remember when they destroyed the two Buddhas?
What did Buddha do? Nothing!
What is the Buddhist terrorist do?
Goes in the middle of the street, takes the gas... Self barbecue!
People are killing each other in the name of God:
""What the fuck are you doing?""
Making your deal with your shit.
I don't understand the whole fundamentalist thing.
I'm an Episcopal. That's catholic light.
Same religion, half the guilt. It's frightening.
Catholics have confession, Episcopals have:
""Thanks Giving your father has a couple of gin and tonics""
""I never loved you mother, you know that, don't you?!""
""I didn't, dad. And she's right there. Tell her again.""
Episcopal is basically Church of England which was Henry the  -th
breaking away from the Catholic Church: ""I'm the fucking Pope now!""
Than people broke away from that church,
the Calvinists found him to be too loose.
Than the Puritans broke away from the Calvinists, our ancestors,
people so uptight, the English kicked them out.
How anal do you have to be for the English to go: ""Get the fuck out!""
""Take your pimp shoes and go!""
And they land here in America going: ""Hello!""
""We bring you guilt, syphilis and alcohol.""
""Here chief, try this and once you drunk it,
keep moving towards your feathers flow. There you go!""
And the Indians go: ""We have a gift for you.""
For us is a secret herb. For you it will be an addictive carcinogen.
""Tobacco is a lot of fun. And a good cash drop, yeah.""
""Welcome to Clusters. The Casino that cares.
This is my wife, sits for full house.
It's time for the white men to get drunk.
And we'll get back the land you took from us.""
The Puritans stayed here and groups broke away from them
and then we got the people who knock on your door
at  :   am on Sunday going:
""Have you found Jesus?""
You just wanna come to the door nude and go:
""No. Help me look for him! Come on!""
People like Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell say:
""This was brought upon us by our sinful ways.""
I wanna put them on a plane, take them to the ayatollah
and have world wide fundamentalist wrestling.
One time only. A life after death match for all of our souls.
Let's get ready to humble.
Here's the drill. Fundamentalists take it to be ""the word"".
Not translatable, not metaphorical: ""the word"".
In the Genesis, ""Let it be light!"" could be a metaphor for the Big Bang?
No. God just went click.
We are all descendants from Adam and Eve. So we are all cousins.
That's right.
There are miracles in the Bible.
Like when Moses, and I'm not talking Guns'N'Moses, no!
Not Charlton Heston going:
""Let the Jews go or pharaoh gets two in the head. No!
Charlton Heston, who said:
""Guns don't kill people... Apes with guns kill people.""
No, Chucky! The second amendment
started from people going like this...
And that still continues. That's OK!
When Moses said to pharaoh: ""Let my people go"".
And pharaoh went: ""In your dreams!""
And Moses called the God: ""God, I need some help!""
And frogs fell from the sky.
Or maybe there were Jews with catapults going: ""Now!"".
Thank God it wasn't the French, 'cause they would go: ""Lunch!""
""You're great caterers, I can't let you go, you crazy people!""
Frogs fell from the sky. I would be going: ""Get your shit and out!""
I said wait a minute! That's what we should drop on Afghanistan.
Not bombs, not food... Fucking frogs!
Frogs, lizards, hamsters, shit the Heaven seen.
If you wanna get people out of caves, a shit load of NY rats.
NY rats would be going: ""Hey, come on, raid!""
""I eat pussy literately. Bring it on!""
Even then pharaoh was not impressed: ""Please, David Copperfield, no!""
And then boils and then first born dies.
""That's it! Hebrews get out!""
And everybody...
Let's not wait for the bread to rise.
Just get the crackers and the skin off your penis. We're leaving.
Excuse me! Why the skin off the penis?
We're traveling, people. You don't want sand in there.
And this is so passé! The dicky thing, forget it. Let's move!
We're going to the desert. Then they get the    commandments,
that would be adjusted later by certain presidents.
And they get to the Red Sea.
And they go: ""What now, Mr Magic, what do we do now?""
We're gonna walk on the ""fregs bocks"", the ""frogs bucks...
Frogs backs!
Thank you for watching me this far.
Obviously, I did inhale.
""What do we do now, Mr BigShot?""
And he calls to God again and the sea parts.
And even the most doubting Jew is going: ""You're good!""
Let's move, don't eat the shellfish. I'll tell you why later.
Where are we going?
To Jerusalem to start years of struggling,
and later to Miami to fuck up an election.
And then the pharaoh comes, the sea closes and he calls his cat-like God
but the cat-like God can't do shit, 'cause it's afraid of water.
And then there's another miracle.
The night that Mary said to Joe: ""Joe, I'm pregnant.""
Joe went: ""Holly Mother of God!"" She went: ""You're right!""
- Oh, Jesus Christ! - What a great name, Joe!
That is so much better than Shmul. Way to go!
- I love you, Joe! - Hold on a minute, Mary.
- So I'm the step father? - Yeah.
I can't discipline him, I can't tell him he's wrong,
'cause he'll look to me saying: ""You're not my real dad.""
- How did it happen? - It's immaculate, Joe.
It better be, Mary! It better be immaculate!
I'm sorry I'm transforming Joe into Ralph Cramdon.
Up to that point, all the names in the Bible are very Jewish.
You have Noah, Moses, Zebedee and then you get Mary and Joe.
We're just a hyphenate away from Mary-Jean and Joe-Bob.
We could've had Jim Bob, the son of God.
Praise to him, Jim-Bob
He, who finds the stuff And gets me a job, Jim-Bob
Jesus was an only child. Thank God!
Who would want to be Jerry, the brother of Christ?
That's a tough gig.
""Come on, Jerry, we're going to the beach.""
Jesus's gonna walk on the water, feed everybody, heal them
and get a whole bunch of disciples.
I'll sat there with a rash and sand in my ass. Great day for me!
He ends up in a bar at the age of    going: ""Yeah, I'm Jerry Christ.
Yeah, I healed somebody. Come here Spot, heel! Look at that!""
Jesus is a carpenter, I'm a plumber. You do the math!
And people say to me Jesus wasn't Jewish... of course he was Jewish!
Thirty years old, single, living at home with his parents, come on.
Working in his father's business,
his mother thought he was God's gift, he's Jewish! Give it up!
It's an old tradition!
And if he was Jewish, and many of his Disciples were Jewish,
for the Last Supper, would they not have gone out for Chinese?
'Welcome to Yahweh. Hold on one minute; no service, no sandals.
Okay, you come in now.
You're twelve. All I got is two tables of six. They're not together.
I also have a table by the window, but you all have to face this way.
You are glowing, so I guess we don't need that lamp, that's very nice!
You've just turned a Szechwan chicken into a live chicken, you very good!'
It's said that night, he turned to his disciples,
and said: ""One of you shall betray me.""
Peter said, ""Is it me, Jesus?"" Jesus said, ""It is not you Peter.""
Simon said, ""Is it me, Jesus?"" Jesus said, ""It is not you Simon.""
And Judas said: ""Is it me, Jesus?""
Jesus turned to him: ""Is it me, Jesus?""
Thus you see two traditions beginning:
Jewish sarcasm and Gentile humor. Together born!
The next day the miracle occurred: Crucifixion, Resurrection
and he rose again from the dead and if he sees his shadow
another
years of guilt. Yes!
For me, the one big question is: how do you get Crucifixion, Resurrection
and then chocolate bunnies, colored eggs?
How do you do that one?
Even kids are going: ""Rabbits don't lay eggs. What is this?""
And you don't want a kid biting the head off a chocolate Jesus.
You don't want a cream filled cross going...
You don't wanna put raspberry jam in the grass going:
""We're looking for Jesus, kids, come one!""
What are we trying to do? You're trying to keep them involved.
That's why we have all the saints that did all those amazing things.
They're all there to keep your action up.
And then we're starting to loose them.
Like Saint Christopher:
""Chris, sorry, babe. Dashboard sales are down.""
""The medals aren't selling well.
Drop the kid off your back, pick up your stuff, you're outta here.""
We're gonna have Saint Prada, all ladies accessories.
But I want a saint like Mother Teresa.
She said: ""You can do only small things with great love.""
And Pat Robinson said: ""She's not a real Christian!""
""Why? 'Cause she doesn't have tag shelter and a university?""
Mother Teresa never had a line of products, her own perfume:
""Compassion"" by Mother Teresa.
""I smell, because I care. Compassion!""
Gandhi never had 'Gandhi Jeans',
whether you're simply not eating and tell the English to get the fuck out.
They come in size one and below.
Gandhi was an amazing man.
They asked him: ""What do you think about Western civilization?""
He said: ""I think it would be a wonderful idea.""
As beatific as Gandhi was, there was somebody in a Bombay bar going:
""I know Gandhi. He was a prick.""
""I saw him sucking on a pork hot-dog, hitting on Mother Teresa.""
""He kept saying: Who's your diaper daddy?""
""I saw that with my eyes.
If you don't believe me, I'll bitch slap you like Shiva.""
""Don't press this. Don't fucking do that!""
Don't go ding-dong, you asshole!
'Cause India has the atomic bomb, my friend.
They could turn this place into Chicken tika.
India has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb.
And we're preparing to fight over Kashmir.
And your president probably thought it was a sweater. What an asshole!
India detonated
ground nuclear tests.
Pakistan detonated
ground nuclear tests.
And your spy satellites were like Ray Charles in the Louvre.
They didn't have a fucking clue.
India has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb.
China has the bomb.
Or maybe they just have one billion people going ""Bum!""
Russia has the bomb. ""We have many bombs.""
We don't know were they all are.
Maybe you want a dirty bomb.
And the French have a bomb, too.
Maybe they have a bomb that only destroys
restaurants under four stars.
They still test their bombs. They still need their bombs.
Where did they do the underground test?
In the Sahara, in the total waste land?
No, fuck off! In Tahiti! In paradise.
Why? ""Because we're French.""
""Look a Green Peace boat coming to protest.
Fuck off, I sink you.""
""I'm the badest mother fucker, am I not?""
""Look, I'm giving a cigarette to a baby.""
""Suck on the cigarette. Life is shit. Get to know this.""
""You, Americans. Fuck all of you Americans!""
""Americans, you politically correct. You cultureless crass Americans.""
""We hate all of you. Fuck off!""
""The Germans are here. Hello, Americans!""
""I love you! Come on, Americans.""
""Welcome back, Americans.""
""You can build the Disneyland near Paris.""
""We won't go, but build it.""
""I will have a Minnie mouse with armpit hair. It will be great!""
Smoking a Garwoise, going: ""I never loved Mickey"".
""He has three fingers. What am I, a bowling ball? Fuck off!""
""Don't love him!""
But there is one country that watches out for all of us:
the Swiss, ya! The Geneva Convention.
If there's ever a nuclear war, they will be the only people going:
""Vhat was that noise?""
In their big hollowed up country,
with their chocolate and their watches. Ya!
The nice Germans. Ya!
Or, as they like to say, ""the other white race.""
I have only one question:
How can you trust an army, that has a wine opener on it's knife?
Many of you, men, have never open a Chardonnay under fire.
You take out the wine bottle, put out the cock and throw.
Y:i I don't know, but I've been told, Chardonnay must be self-cold
My God! Where did all this Impressionistic art come from?
And all these jewelry from
to
?
Fairies must've brought it during the night.
I have to do the vault Heimlich and cough up an account number.
I know this one thing...
I know there's one country that's not developing a weapon of destruction.
That does not have a secret weapons' lab up in the mountains.
Jamaica!
Howdy, man!
Jamaica would never make an atomic bomb.
They may make an atomic bong.
When the atomic bomb goes off,
there's devastation and radiation.
When the atomic bong goes off, there's celebration!
Smoke a split for the communion.
If you don't see Jesus than, you never will.
I know only one thing.
I never met me an angry pot smoker.
I never met a man who said: ""Hey, you fucking prick!""
""Oh, fuck!
What was I gonna do?!""
""Hold me, you piece of shit. Get over here!""
Because you see, marijuana...
I know this one. Wait a minute.
If you smoke a lot of pot, you may never become a rocket scientist.
Or maybe...
If you seen some of the things that happen lately to NASA, maybe you can.
The Mars Lander...
I did the calculations in feet,
but I programmed the Lander in meters.
So, instead of landing, fucker buried!
million dollars... oopsy!
Two years... splat!
OK, fuck! Here's a better one!
The Hubble Telescope...
I forgot to put in a lens.
Read the top line. ""Officer Jerry, serial...""
""The rest is just a black hole.""
I once called Steven Hawking. ""Hello, this is Steven Hawking""
- I'd like to leave a message. - No. This is Steven Hawking.
I know one thing though.
Pot is not like alcohol. Alcohol changes your moods.
Go to a bar at happy hour and see some happy mother fuckers there.
Guys going: ""Hey, fuck you, my man!""
""Hey, listen to me.""
""Listen to me, you piece of shit.""
""You do not know shit about fuck, my man.""
""You want a piece of yourself?""
""Step outside, I'll kick my ass"".
""I've already shit myself. I'm half way there"".
You can deal with the genetic.
If you're Irish, you've got a running start
that you can do it better than we are.
Not only will you kick my ass, but you'll sing about it, afterwards.
Y:i ""Oh, the night you said my wife was fat,
Y:i I knocked you down and shit in your hat.""
And you keep drinking 'till you're in your   s and you're on a dialysis,
doing liver dancing Michael Flatly.
They say the Irish saved civilization,
drank a couple of Guinness
and forgot where they fucking put it. But that's all right!
The Japanese drink differently than us.
You could be polite during the day
and all of a sudden you're: ""Arigato gozaimas""
And after five Jack Daniels: ""Tide the yellow ribbon!""
Karaoke for an asshole with a microphone.
Sing, you round eyed fuck, come on!
If ya want a linguistic adventure, go drinkin' with a Scotsman.
'Cause ya couldn't fucking understand them before...
You land in Scotland and they're going:
- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah?
- Sure. - Oh, fuck sure, eh!
- Sure! - Sure, you dumb fucking bastard.
You realize how drunk they get, they could wear a skirt and not care!
And only they could invent a sport like golf.
Here's my idea for a fucking sport.
I knock a ball in a gopher hole.
- Like pool? - Fuck off pool.
Not with a straight stick, with a little fucked up stick.
I whack a ball, it goes in a gopher hole.
- Oh, you mean like croquet? - Fuck croquet!
I put the hole hundreds of yards away.
Oh, fuck of ya ! Big fun, yeah!
- Oh, like a bowling thing? - Fuck no!
Not straight. I put shit in the way.
Like trees and bushes and high grass.
So you can lose you fucking ball.
And go hacking away with a fucking tire iron.
Whacking away, and each time you miss you feel like you'll have a stroke.
Fuck that's what we'll call it, a stroke,
cause each time you miss you feel like you're gonna fucking die.
Oh great, oh and here's the better part. Fuck, this is brilliant!
Right near the end, I'll put a little flat piece
with a little flag to give you fucking hope.
But then I'll put a little pool and a sand box,
to fuck with your ball again.
Ay, you'll be there cracking you ass, jacking away in the sand.
- And you do this one time? - Fuck no!
fucking times!
That's my idea of a sport!
The manly sport of golf,
where you can dress like a pimp and no one will care.
Even a gay blind man would go: ""Oh, dear Christ!""
""Those are loud. This is no carnival. What a fuck are you on?""
Even the alligators are going: ""Asshole!""
It's such an athletic sport: whack the ball, get in the car.
Whack the ball, get in the car.
And the commentary's electrifying.
Just this side of Curling, for really getting me going.
Third hole.
Could people be quiet, I'd like to hear the grass grow.
I'd like the guy who does Mexican soccer to do golf one time.
The ball is ready.
Hole!
Just to see al those waspy mother fuckers going:
""Oh, dear Christ!""
""My God, they're not gardening, they're playing now, oh, shit!""
What a hell we gonna do? That was their last domain of dominance.
It was their area. They were the kings.
Up until Tiger!
Son of a black man and a Thai woman.
Not even a German geneticist could've thought than one up!
Black athletic ability, Buddhist concentration.
Crouching Putter.
And than he goes to the British Open,
and he plays at Saint Andrews, who the fucking invented the sport.
And after the forth round, he's    under par.
And there's only    fucking holes.
And all the old men going: ""My God, we're doomed!""
""How did he learn to play? We wouldn't have let him join.""
And they start having nightmares of golf carts going...
Y:i Yo, yo, yo I'm playing through
Y:i Whether you're gentile or a Jew
Y:i Mother fucker!
All the gentle sports are no longer gentle. Tennis used to be...
Untill the Williams sisters...
-    love? - No. That's good love, baby!
Even boxing is changed.
Before people were saying ""I go to boxing to watch the sport of boxing.""
like saying, ""I go to stock car races
to see people take left turns all day.""
No, you go to boxing to see somebody get the fuck beat up.
Even the guy who loses is going: ""I have    million dollars.""
""I don't know where the fucking is.
I'm gonna buy me a big ass house, but I can't find it. Fuck off!""
Boxing was the same. And then: Mike Tyson!
Mike Tyson comes along and bites somebody.
Let's get ready to nibble!
""Oh, dear God, he bit somebody!""
I'm saying ""You're lucky he just bit somebody.
Mike just got out of prison. You're lucky he didn't fuck him.""
You bite somebody in jail: ""You're ready bitch, you're mine!""
- Break it up! - We're not finish.
Mike said to a journalist: ""I'm gonna fuck you, too! You love me.""
At that point I'm going: ""Someone didn't come here to box, baby.""
Mike said: ""I'm on Zoloft, so I don't kill you, mother fuckers!""
I'm going: ""Up the dosage, Mike!""
There's all these drugs: Zoloft, Prozac.
I wanna have one drug encompassing it all.
Call it ""FuckItAll"".
I don't feel anything. I don't wanna do anything. ""FuckItAll""
The closest thing to a coma you'll ever be. ""FuckItAll""
I'm sitting here in my own dong. ""FuckItAll""!
The scary thing about drugs is that they have horrible side effects.
""May cause artificial insemination.""
What? What do you mean?
There's a product called Olestra, which is a very strange thing.
Olestra? What is that?
It's said on a little said: ""May cause anal leakage.""
That's not a side effect if my ass is going...
I'd say that's an effect, really!
""Fire in the hole!"" Bad day!
- How you're doing, Bob? - Just a little anal leakage, Ted.
Bob, you wanna get out of the pool right now?
I want science to help me. God, look at me! Look at this!
I had women in NY saying: ""Don't wear fur!""
The politically correct... red paint: ""Fuck off, lady, it's me!""
I'm a fucking Chia Pat.
I went to the Zoo and had monkeys go:
Anybody who thinks the Zoo is a happy place,
go watch the monkeys wait for groups of school children.
Watch the fun. The monkeys sit there, like...
""Wait for it"".
""Wait till the teacher comes with the video camera.""
""Now!""
Because they're not happy.
Even the poor animals like Ling Ling the Panda,
she must mate, so you can build a wing on the Zoo.
They go to China, they anesthetize a Panda,
which is kinda redundant...
They bring him back to America and give him a name like Ping Pong.
When his Chinese name was Who Shu Ko Hu,
Bear with Balls of Steel.
They put him in a cage with Ling Ling, saying: ""Go, mate!""
He looks at her like: ""I would never fuck her!""
""That is one ugly Panda bitch.""
""If you were Panda, you'd know that's the fucking ugliest Panda bitch.""
I wouldn't have fuck her with a Koala's dick!
Fuck off!
I would rather lick my own balls, than fuck that Panda bitch!
There's only one animal who can tell you
if she's happy and wants to mate.
That is Coco, the silver back Gorilla.
She saw me, the blue eyed simian.
She was intrigued.
She said to her trainer...
- What is that mean? - She wants you to tickle her.
OK, I tickle her...
Then she goes...
- What is that mean? - She wants you to lift your shirt.
I lift my shirt, she reaches out and grabs both my nipples.
And when an
pound Gorilla's got you by the tits...
you listen!
Then my balls went: ""Somebody wants to play.""
- Should we go to phase two? - NO! Do not go to phase two!
""I repeat! Do not go to liftoff!""
""This may feel like a human, but notice the placement of the thumbs.""
""This is not a human!""
""Do not go to phase two!""
""Warning! Warning!""
She must've sense something, 'cause she grabs me by the hand,
takes me in the back. Daktari meets Delivrance.
I'm expecting the Crocodile Hunter to walk out and go:
""Cranky! She wants to fuck his brains out.""
""Watch out, boys and girls. Danger! Danger! Danger!""
""This could be like that time I put my finger in a crock's cloette.""
But part of me went: ""Could be fun!""
Would make a great story for a bar.
A guy's going: ""I had a wild night in Vegas.""
""Yeah? I banged a Gorilla.""
""Where's everybody going?""
And you don't want that late night phone call: ""Hello?""
""Don't call me!""
Maybe it's because I'm   .
When you hit    the old machinery doesn't work so well.
You're at a public rest-room: ""How're you doing? Great game today.""
""Oh, boy!""
What's happened is: your prostate is bigger than your ego now.
When you're in your   s, you go to the doctor they have to do the old...
First time is: ""Oh, my God!""
""I'm just putting on the glove, Mr Williams""
I went back the second time and I moaned another doctor's name.
Don't do that!
- Who's Dr Smith? - You're the only one!
When a woman has to go to the gynecologist,
you don't want a doctor who has a hobby.
You don't want a gynecologist who's also a magician.
You don't want: ""How are we today? Uh, a dove!""
""What's this?!""
""Is this your card?""
I don't want a doctor who's a proctologist and ventriloquist. No!
How you're doing today?
Take your hand out' of my ass. I'm not a Muppet. Move it!
In your   s it's no longer the... It's the ortho-proctoscope.
The colonoscopy. That's what W did.
It's a video camera at the end of a rodeo rudder.
And it's going up you!
Suddenly, you're your own Discovery Channel Special.
""Slowly, we're going up Robin's colon.""
""This must be what you see.""
""Slowly up ahead, a burger he had in '  .""
- Is that a polyp? - That's a fart, Mr Williams.
To go further up your ass, they blow air.
Now you're a fucking party favor.
Oh, doctor, give me all you can take! I'm a man. Give me
psi!
You feel like a Piñata, you think little Mexican kids
are gonna come out and go: ""Get the presents!""
The air is coming this way. The farts are going: ""Incoming!""
""It's not a... No finger! It's the midget!
""Fall back behind the shit, wait for my command!""
""Prepare to make the wet sloppy noise!""
The moment they pull out off your ass, you are on Heaven road!
Y:i Rolling, rolling, rolling Keep that colon flowing!
miles, blowing outta you!
You put on your pants and floating like a balloon on America's Cup.
Come on, Jimmy.
Then you realize... Oh, shit, fire in the hole!
Tighten up boys, we're not gonna drop here.
Thank you, doctor. See you next week.
Hold the elevator!
Fuck you, you bastard!
Seven flights of stairs.
Everybody you pass, you're going: ""It's me!""
Dogs look at you like: ""Roll over, man, you're dad!""
You just wanna borrow a match. Give me that!
Flaming asshole.
That's what you are. You're a flaming asshole! You're   !
And can they make a drug to help you through all of that,
to keep all of your organs intact until your golden years? No!
Can they make a drug to give you
mental clarity to your golden time? No!
They've got a drug to make you harder than Chinese algebra!
Grandpa can have wood again.
- I don't need the walker! - I see that!
And your Grandmother's going:
""Shit! I thought the war was over!""
""Get me a tetanus shot, if you gonna stick me with that rusty thing!""
People have died on Viagra. They had to have an open coffin!
""I don't remember Pete being like that.""
""Kids, go get some horse shoes"".
""He would've wanted it that way.""
You used to get that from some strange Chinese aphrodisiacs.
Humming bird eyelash and rhino horn.
To give you great masculinity.
But now you're on Viagra. You're FrankenCock!
You are the Inseminator!
You are ready to go!
You're gonna be going for one hour, one hour and a half!
Guys are going: ""Yeah!"" Women are going:...
'Cause after the first hour, your wife is going:
Yay, oh, big daddy...
Listen, I got shit to do, OK?
""Hello!""
""Yeah, I'll be late today. Viagra, fucking...""
""I'll try and get there. Go outside with that thing!""
You can't go outside with a hard-on
cause the cat just waits for you to go...
And your dog is going: ""Wow, you too?!""
Can't go to work like:
- Hey, Bob! - How're you, Pete?
I'm happy to be here today.
Direct traffic, no, you can't do shit!
You have to make it go away. You slap it.
It's like one of those Punch-Me clowns.
""I'm not going anywhere!""
You have to freeze it up.
In the old days was...
Now, after an hour and a half,
you've got more semen than the Fifth Fleet.
So, when you go, it's like...
Oh, my eyes!
And your wife goes: ""Now you know how it feels, asshole!""
Aim for the tits, Hawk Eye!
I'm like the Lawn boy. Get out!
Save yourselves!
- Not the drapes! - Too late.. I own them now.
You run out of semen and your testicles are going:
""We still got an erection, chief!""
Give me blood, give me urine, any fluid!
Oh, God, please make this fucking shit go away!
You do every goofy, fucking orgasmic thing...
Don't touch it!
Don't look at it!
Don't even think about it!
And then you realize that God
gave you a penis and a brain.
And only enough blood to run one at a time.
You have lost thoughts from your childhood.
And then you hear these words from your lady:
""My turn!""
You can't fucking be serious!
Look at me, I'm Glue Boy! What are you doing?
That's right, Corky! Time to saddle up.
We're heading South of the border.
You gotta please Missy.
I have one question for the ladies:
Do we look like this?
Are you almost there?
No, no, no. I will finish!
I love you!
I love you! I will finish.
I can take it. I just can't feel my tongue.
Who's your daddy?
I love you!
I will finish.
Good night!
Thank you!
Thank you!
This night for New York!
What are we gonna do tonight?
Good night!
You're the best!
We did it!
My pink lady...

247,Jim Reeves,1,Distant Drums,1966,"

I hear the sound of distant drums
Far away, far away
And if they call for me to come
Then I must go and you must stay

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
Let's share all the time we can before it's too late
Love me now for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

I hear the sound of bugles blow
Far away, far away
And if they call, then I must go
Across the sea, so wild and grey

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
For the distant drums might change our wedding date
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

"
248,Sonny James,2,Take Good Care Of Her,1966,"

I supposed I ought to say congratulations
For you've won the only girl I'll ever love
But I've hurt too much to face the situation
So take good care of her take good care of her
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
To take good care of her take good care of her
I must accepted she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitations
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy that will be my consolation
Just take good care of her take good care of her take good care of her

"
249,Buddy Starcher,3,History Repeats Itself,1966,"

Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
This is a strange but true story
Which proves that history
Does repeat itself
And the events depicted here
Happened just one hundred years apart
Both President Lincoln
And President Kennedy
Were concerned with
The issue of civil rights
Lincoln was elected
In eighteen hundred sixty
Kennedy was elected
In ninteen hundred sixty
One hundred years apart
Both were shot from behind in the head
Their successors both named Johnson
Were Southern Democrats
With seats in the Senate
Andrew Johnson was born
In eighteen hundred and eight
Lyndon Johnson was born
In nineteen hundred and eight
One hundred years apart
John Wilkes Booth
The man that shot Lincoln
Was born in 1839
Lee Harvey Oswald
The man that shot Kennedy
Was born in 1939
One hundred years apart
Booth and Oswald were Southerners
Favoring unpopular ideas
Booth and Oswald were both
Assassinated before going to trial
Both presidents wives
Log on to kill this message
Lost children through death
While in the White House
Both presidents were killed on a Friday
And in the presence of their wives
President Lincoln's secretary
Whose name was Kennedy
Advised him not to go to the theater
President Kennedy's secretary
Whose name was Lincoln
Advised him not to go to Dallas
John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln
In a theater and ran to a warehouse
Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy
From a warehouse and ran to a theater
The names Lincoln and Kennedy
Each contain seven letters
The names Andrew Johnson
And Lyndon Johnson each
Contain thirteen letters
The names John Wilkes Booth
And Lee Harvey Oswald
Each contain fifteen letters
And friends, it is true
History does repeat itself
His truth is marching on

250,Bill Anderson,4,I Love You Drops,1966,"

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
They're I love you drops
'Cause I love you. (I love you.)

They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them
Falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight

I love you drops
I miss you drops
Hurry home drops
You've been gone so long drops

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome
And I love you, (I love you.)

Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek

I love you drops
I miss you drops
Hurry home drops
You've been gone so long drops

They're not teardrops
Just sincere drops
That say I'm lonesome
And I love you. (hurry home.)

I love you. (I love you.)...

251,Warner Mack,5,Talkin' To The Wall,1966,"

[Verse 1]
Oh I might as well be talking to the wall
I've known so long with me you’ve been unsatisfied
So I finally found the strength to say goodbye
Why already I forgot a million memories and leaving you was easy as could be

[Chorus]
But I might as well be talking to the wall when I tell myself I'm not missing you at all
'Cause every time you come around I’ll fall and I might as well be talking to the wall

[Verse 2]
Oh it seems there's not a day that some friend of mine
Won't bring back a mem'ry I'll recall
Then I smile and say you know it's been a long long time
And I hardly remember her at all

[Chorus]
Oh but I might as well be talking to the wall when I tell myself I'm not missing you at all
'Cause every time you come around I’ll fall and I might as well be talking to the wall
Yes I might as well be talking to the wall

252,The Harden Trio,6,Tippy Toeing,1966,
253,Dottie West,7,Would You Hold It Against Me,1966,"

Would you hold it against me
If I just see him one more time
Just so I can make certain
I can leave him behind

Would it make any difference
If I just called him once again
Now you know that I love you
But have I forgotten him

He was my love 'til you came my way
Now I can't help but wonder
Have I made a mistake?
Just suppose
I remember things he used to say
After our wedding day

Would you hold it against me
If I just see him once again
Then I'll know that I love you
And that I've forgotten him

For he was my love 'til you came my way
So I can't help but wonder
Have I made a mistake?
Just suppose
I remember the things he used to say
After our wedding day

Would you hold it against me
If I just see him once again
Then I'll know that I love you
And that I've forgotten him

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're going away
But leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
So stay just one more day...

Your hand is like a torch, each time you touch me
The look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart

Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
And I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we've never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart

Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then lose you wouldn't be smart on my part

Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart
No, don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart

George Jones
Now if I was a monkey, a-workin' for a livin'
I'd be a-gettin' instead of a-givin'
A-hangin' by my tail, a-waitin' for the dinner bell
Puttin' humans on
Every day them fools rush in
And lay down the cash and watch me grin
I put 'em all on, I'd hum a little song
An' watch 'em all go tee-hee
But I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, sh-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E
An' you got a people that looks like, me
Now a monkey don't have to go down town
An' ask for a job an' gettin' turned down
I'm mad at me, I could smash me
'Cause I am a people
--- Instrumental ---
Now, a monkey don't have to shoot an' speak
All he do is scratch his fleas
Oh, me, what luxury
But I'm a people
Now I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, a-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E
An' you got a creature that looks like, me
Now if anyone knocked on my door today
There'd be a little sign says: Gone away
Down to the zoo, diggin' you know who
'Cause I'm a people
Now I spell a P, a little bitty E
Sweet bop, bop, bop, sh-shoo, shoobie doobie doh
In a little round O
Now you add another P, a big skinny L
There's a-one more E

259,Jean Shepard,13,Many Happy Hangovers To You,1966,"

You're goin' out again tonight and you'll end up gettin' tired
Then when your money's gone you'll come crawlin' home to me
You'll think you're quiet as a mouse as you come stumblin' through the house
And find the note with these parting words from me
Many happy hangovers to you may your life be blessed with more than a few
Oh our love can never be you hold a bottle more than me
Many happy hangovers to you

When tomorrow sun comes up you'll be sicker than a pup
And your blood shot eyes will look around for me
But you'll find yourself alone like the many nights I've known
With only lonely walls for company
Many happy hangovers...

I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you

I wish I were glass
So you could see through
Then you'd know before you ask
That I wanna go with you

I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you

You take me away
To a world I never knew
But what else can say
I wanna go with you

I wanna go with you
To that other world
The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you

The one your love takes me to
I wanna go with you...

262,Ray Price,16,A Way To Survive,1966,
263,Johnny Cash,17,The One On The Right Is On The Left,1966,"

There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
I saw her and told myself
She was my dream come true
Let my eyes deceive me
From the start

[Verse 2]
They told me I wanted her
More than I wanted you
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

[Chorus]
Wasn't I the foolish one
Lord above, what have I done
For her love
I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good
I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger
Than my heart

[Verse 3]
I allowed these eyes of mine
To lead me into sin
Made me think
That I could love her true

[Verse 4]
Now she stands out in the cold
My heart won't let her in
There was only room
Enough for you

[Chorus]
Wasn't I the foolish one
Lord above, what have I done
For her love
I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good
I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger than my heart

[Verse 1: Merle Haggard]
This old smoke filled bar
Is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you
Satisfied
And I just called to let you know
Where I'd be living
It's not much
But I feel welcome here inside

[Chorus: Merle Haggard]
I got swinging doors
And a jukebox
And a barstool
My new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me
Anytime you want to
Because I'm always here at home, till closing time

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
Well, I got everything it takes
To drive me crazy
I've got everything I need
To lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere
Is just right for it
And thanks to you
I'm always here till closing time

267,Wilburn Brothers,21,Someone Before Me,1966,"

Someone before me still turns you inside out
When we're together he's all you talk about
You're always wanting me to do the things he used to do
Someone before me sure left his mark on you
I've tried to get inside your heart but I don't have a chance
I can see he's on your mind with every little glance
You're living on old mem'ries my love can't get through to you
Someone before me sure left his mark on you
( piano - steel )
I've tried to get inside your heart...

268,Connie Smith,22,Nobody But A Fool (Would Love You),1966,"

Nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule
Who'd lie awake all night cryin' till you were out of sight
Loving you with all of her might nobody but a fool

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head
All I knew was your two lips kissed me heavenly
Till yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me
Nobody but a fool would love you...

Well people tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose
But I was blind as any bat and deaf as any post
You caught me like a tiger I loved you like a lamb
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am
Cause nobody but a fool would love...

269,Liz Anderson,23,Go Now Pay Later,1966,"

You're breaking up this time that has been ours
To you it’s just a prison without bars
You don't know what
But lasting tears will be your freedom
Won't be quite exactly free

Go now, pay later
When time decides how many tears you’ll cry
Go now, pay later
The cost of leaving may be much too high

You leave our little children half grown
They'll grow up having only half a home
They love you now
But when they're not so small
You'll be someone who gets presents and that's all
Go now, pay later

270,Slim Whitman,24,The Twelfth Of Never,1966,
271,Stonewall Jackson,25,The Minute Men (Are Turning In Their Graves),1966,"

They march in lines and carry signs protesters one and all
They'd rather go to prison than to heed their country's call
Get out of here get out of there let's have an end to war
I'm glad they weren't around to say get out of Valley Forge

The Minute Men are turning in their graves
Washington and Jefferson are crying tears of shame
To see these men who'd rather live as slaves
The Minute Men are turning in their graves

What's happened to our heritage what's happen to our pride
Since when do free Americans pull for the other side
Did we send food to Hitler's troops or praise the enemy
Did all our children die in vain defending liberty

The Minute Men are turning in their graves...

I can't condemn a man who feels that taking life is wrong
But I fail to understand a man that won't defend his home
Dear Lord I've got one little prayer I pray in years to come
Don't ever let those kind of people serve in Washington

The Minute Men are turning in their graves...
Oh the Minute Men are turning in their graves
Oh the Minute Men are turning in their graves

273,Porter Wagoner,27,I Just Came To Smell The Flowers,1966,"

I just came to smell the flowers here in someone's darkest hour
I don't even know the one they've laid to rest
But anyplace there's a crowd and anywhere they're cryin' loud
Just seems to be the place I love the best

Surrounded by the blues in a place that losers use
Where one smile cost at least a million tears
Look in for my past in the bottom of a glass
The only place I've looked for many years
Now the ground don't seem so very low when you're down about as far as you can go
And it's pretty hard to smile while the whole world laugh in your face
And with no will left to live the world moves fast while you lie still
Too weak to stand and just not enough man to join the race
So I just came to smell the flowers...

274,Norma Jean,28,The Shirt,1966,"

[Verse 1]
We were just kids
Thought we knew everything
Heartbeat fast like a hummingbird wing
There in the dark
In the back of your car
We swore we'd always be

[Verse 2]
You helped me take a drag
Of my first cigarette
Burned me left a scar
So I would not forget
Sneaking out late
Getting drunk for the sake of it
We watched the moon go down

[Chorus]
They said we were too young
To know if it was true love
They couldn't have been more wrong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you
If we give one more shot
We'll know if it's real or not
This feeling's way too strong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you

[Verse 3]
Thought I saw you
Walking down Main Street
Was it my mind playing dirty tricks on me?
The summer storms
Your shirt that I wore
Does the rain make you think of me?

[Chorus]
They said we were too young
To know if it was true love
They couldn't have been more wrong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you
If we give one more shot
We'll know if it's real or not
This feeling's way too strong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you

[Bridge]
Happy ever after
Was our plan the master
Tell me you remember
How we used to know

[Chorus]
They said we were too young
To know if it was true love
They couldn't have been more wrong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you
If we give one more shot
We'll know if it's real or not
This feeling's way too strong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
I still love you, I'm still in love with you
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
I still love you, I'm still in love with you

To know if it was true love
They couldn't have been more wrong
I still love you
I'm still in love with you

Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me

The last word in lonesome is me...
My heart is as lonely...

Everywhere I go heartache just hurts me so
I can't escape from you, and I'm hurting
Sorrow is by my side, misery is my guide
Every minute is blue, and I'm hurting
Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you
I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting
Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you
I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting, I'm hurting

Two broken hearts lonely, looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief
Pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can and some can't
And some can
Two broken hearts lonely, looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief
Pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the number of husbands and wives

I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say

Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say

Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry

"
282,Jan Howard,36,Evil On Your Mind,1966,"

You say I need the rest why don't I go and see my sister way out west
That's very thoughtful of you dear I'm really touched by all this tenderness
But us women are suspicious things
We know that men aren't born with wings what's making you so kind
Now I'm not smart but I'm not blind I think that you've got evil on your mind
You think that you've been good about as long as muskart blooded human could
We've been together for so long I know another pasture's looking good
Don't think that other men don't look at me that certain way from time to time
Don't think that you're the only one that must conted with evil on your mind
Your mind is in the hare man surrounded by exotic dancing girls
You're hearing pretty music as they run their slender fingers through your curles
Ah dream on baby
I thank you for the flowers and the candy honey that was very kind
For that's your way of telling me you're sorry for the evil on your mind

"
283,George Hamilton IV,37,Steel Rail Blues,1966,"

Well I got my mail late last night a letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewher's in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too to take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well I been up tight most every night walkin' around the streets of this old town
Not a friend around to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love
Well I look over yonder across that plain
The big drive wheels a poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal and Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love

Well here I am with my hat in my hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love

"
284,Dave Dudley,38,Viet Nam Blues,1966,"

I was out on the leave at the time just duckin' the fog nosin' around like a hungry dog
In that crazy place called Washington DC
I saw a crowd of people on the White House lawn all carrying signes about VietNam
So I went over to see what was goin' on
It was a strange looking bunch but then I never could understand some people
Oh a fellow came to me with a list in his hand he said we're gatherin' names to send
The telegram of sympathy then he handed me a pen
I said I reckon this is goin' to kids and wives
My friends over there who're givin' their lives
He said ah ah buddy this is goin' to Ho-Chi-Min
I said Ho-Chi who he said Ho-Chi-Min people's leader North VietNam
Oh I wasn't really sure I was hearin' him right
I though I'd better move before I got in a fight
Cause my ears were hurtin' and my ball started hit my lick
Then I thought of another telegram that I've just read
Tellin' my buddy's wife that her husband was dead
It wasn't too long till I was feelin' downright sick
Another held the sign that said we won't fight
I thought to myself boy ain't that right
To leave a lot of our soldiers die instead
I said it's a shame that every man who ever died up there that far off land
Was dyin' for that you wouldn't have to wake up dead
Course he looked at me like I was kinda crazy just another warmonger
Oh I left that place and I went downtown and hit first bar that I'd found
To cool myself off and pacify my brain
You see I was on orders to VietNam little old place just north to Saigon
Had about an hour to catch myself a plane
So all I mean to say is I don't like dyin' either but man I ain't gonna crawl

Well we just left the courthouse this morning
And the judge said we could go our seperate ways
And everything we own must be divided just like the separation papers say
You can keep the curtains and the tables and the chairs
And all those dirty dishes in the sink
Well you can take that golf club and the television set
And that lawnmower that's always on the blink
You can keep all the records and the hi-fi set
You can take that phoney fireplace and the log
Now you keep the car you keep the boat and I'll take the dog
No I'll take the dog oh no I'm gonna take the dog
Well who's gonna bring me my paper who's gonna keep me company
You'll just have to give him up no I ain't a partin' with the pupp
The dog belongs to me
Now hold on Ray you ain't gonna take this dog away from me
I'm the one that feeds him every day
And who always takes care of him when he's sick
Now wait just a minute Jeannie I guess that you forget
Who it was that always took him to the bed
Paid for all of them shots of seven bucks a lick
You can just forget about him I ain't leaving you without him
Then you'll just have to stay I guess that's the only way okay
I'll give back the curtains and the tables and the chairs
And I'll wash the dirty dishes in the sink
And I won't take the golf clubs and the television set
And I'll fix that mower that's always on the blink
We'll both listen to the records on the hi-fi set
By the fireplace with this gas burnin' log
We'll go ridin' in our car and we'll go sailin' in our boat
And we'll both take the dog yes we'll both take the dog
Come on baby (huff huff)

And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

But the shirt on my back
And an old two button suit
I walked outta my job
About a week ago
And now I'm sleepin' in a
Telephone booth
But I'm a-gonna be
The richest guy around
The day you say you're mine

I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Well, when I first saw you babe
You nearly made me wreck
My ol' '49 Cadillac
I knew at a glance
That it was you for me;
I had to have your love by heck
I'm gonna follow you baby
Wherever you go;
I got nothin' to lose
But my time

I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Well, you made me
The top dog on your hill
And I was overjoyed
But it didn't take long
'Til the thrill was gone
I joined the ranks of
The unemployed
Now, I'm right back where
That I started from
But that ain't gonna
Change my mind

I got the hungries for your love
And I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Yeah, I'm waitin' in your welfare line

I know that I'm not great, and some say I imitate
Anymore I don't know, I'm just doin' the best I can
After all I'm standin' in the shadows, of a very famous man

Spoken
As I travel around, from town to town
I have a lot of dad's fans and friends come around
They say I know Hank would be proud of you if he were here today
While we're all so glad and we know he would be too
That you're carryin' on his music this way
Yes they say Hank was the all time great
And we know you'll be just as good as your dad
But I just smile and say there'll never be another Hank Williams friends
That's the part that always makes them sad

Yes I know that I'm not great, and some say I imitate
Anymore I don't know, I'm just doin' the best I can
It's hard standin' in the shadows, of a very famous man

Spoken
So many times when I'm on that stage, I feel something go through me
And for a minute I'm in a different world, and that's when it does something to me
The people are a hollerin' and clappin' real loud, while I'm out they're taking my bows
I look up toward the ceiling and I say to myself, listen dad, just listen to that crowd
But as the show goes on, the people clap and holler more, I start to sing another of your great songs
That's the time that I know although you're gone, your music will live on and on and on

[Verse 1]
Once i lived the life of wine and roses
And i drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn

[Chorus]
But now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose

[Verse 2]
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn i made was not the one i'd planned
And i watched my social standings slip away from me
While i watched the bottle slowly take command

[Chorus]
And now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life i chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose
'Cause i kept the wine and threw away the rose

Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat'em join'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Cause your good girl's gonna go bad

I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact you'll hardly regonize your wife
I buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Because your good girl'd gonna go bad

If I kiss you will you go away like in the game my mother used to play
You're so much hurt I wish you wouldn't stay if I kiss you will you go away

My mom would come when I get hurt at play she kiss my hurt and it would go away
But now I'm grown I don't know what to do I've never known a bigger hurt than you
If I kiss you will you go away...

You have painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
For it wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
And I know Ruby that I'm not the man I used to be
But Ruby I still need your company
[ ac.guitar ]
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
She's leaving now for I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
For God's sake turn around don't take your love to town

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the leaves are falling
It's you, it's you, must go and I must 'bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine and in shadow
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so

But when you've come if all the flow'rs are dying
And if I am dead, and dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" over for me
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warmer sweeter be
And you will call and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace 'til you come to me
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so

Don't build for me no paper mansions that only stand until you've gone

You always leave me holding on to pretty words that glow
You've built a thousand mansions out of dreams that seemed so strong
But they're always made of paper not of stone
Don't build for me no paper mansion that I can never call my own
For love can't live in paper mansions that only stand until you've gone

You've always been a dreamer dear and I'm a dreamer too
But I guess I've had too many of the time that don't come true
So don't build me no mansion with paper walls so thin
That only stand until you leave again
Don't build for me...

I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge
I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge

Well, I hope that the train
From Caribou Maine
Runs over your new love affair

You never was my woman
Because you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall
Lord, I hope that it falls on you

If she seems cold and bitter I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's gone through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember life turned her that way

And I hate to admit it but that last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way

She's been stepped on...

With one exception and she's waiting at home
If I let temptation fill me I know your kiss would thrill me
And how easy it would be to lead you on
You're such a lovely girl you're perfect for my world
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Sometimes I almost cheated after all I'm just a man
Can't you see my world is wrapped up in a golden wedding band
I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Yes I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home

I would guess your age to be twenty eight going on three
So I'll speak in a language you can understand
When the big hand is on twelve...

Yes, I know you like to play
But we've got our bills to pay
And the kids need shoes
Much more than you need fun

When the big hand is on twelve...

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

My mother and my father were in love for 50 years
So when dad died we wondered why my mother shed no tears
We asked her once about it but she wouldn't tell us why
Instead she'd walk outside each night and smile up at the sky
Then just before she left us she called us to her side…
She told us what my father said to her just before he died

I remember when you said you'd never leave me
Through these golden years i've kept the same vow too
But now that I am going please don't leave me
I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

You can look up every night and you'll see me light the light
Where I'll watch for you to join me someday soon
We'll go lookin through the stars for the heaven that is ours
And I know we'll find it soon somewhere just beyond the moon

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

I'll just sit there by a star and I'll watch you from afar
Til I see you walking toward me someday soon
Then together hand in hand we'll find our promised land
And we'll settle down forever darlin' just beyond the moon

I'll walk just beyond the moon then I'll stop and wait for you

But I'll be back again Joe tomorrow night
And we'll hear about baby

When all your loves have ended when all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you when all your loves have gone
Only a fool would do it after the way you've done
But how many fools would have you I know one
This fool keeps wondering why he fell in love at all
But you might need this fool around in case you fall
After the party's over and you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you I know one

You never know you might be lonely when all your loves have missed
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra fool on your list
After your heart's been broken and it needs a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you I know one hmm yes I know one hmm I know one

Oh, but I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my world a misty blue

Just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things we used to do
Then my whole world turns misty blue

I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried
But when I said I'm glad we're through
My heart knows I've lied

Oh, it's been such a long, long time

As I look at the letters that you wrote to me

As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love

I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime when you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love

322,Wilma Burgess,26,Fifteen Days,1967,
323,Warner Mack,27,Drifting Apart,1967,"

[Verse 1]
Drifting apart drifting apart seems like we're drifting drifting apart
Well I can see your love for me is fadin' and slowly dying
And I can seem to get to you no matter how hard I keep trying
That world of love we built so high is fallin' apart
Each passin' day just leaves another star
And it's tearin' out my heart

[Refrain]
'Cause now we're drifting apart drifting apart seems like we're drifting drifting apart

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to tell myself that I won't even hurt if you leave me
But I don't think my heart could stand to ever really lose you completely
The roots of love are just too deep to up and throw away
The more you're near the more I wanna stay
And it hurts so much to say

[Refrain]
That now we're drifting apart drifting apart seems like we're drifting drifting apart

324,Eddy Arnold,28,Lonely Again,1967,"

Album: The Essential Eddy Arnold
Composer: Don Chapel

You told me that others before you
Were foolish to cause me to cry
And just when I learned to adore you
You kissed one more dream goodbye

And left me lonley again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again

You told me you wanted me only
That this time and this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely
And now you belong to the past

And I'm so lonley again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again

"
325,'Little Jimmy Dickens',29,Country Music Lover,1967,"

Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
""Well I already knew we disagreed on politics and religion
And it didn't really bother me too much when I found out she didn't like to go fishin
The trouble all started with them phonograph records I bought her
Like she thought ""Kitty Wells"" was a place a cat goes to get water
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
But friends it didn't take me long to realize that this ol girl was in a fog
Why she even thought that ""Ferlin Husky"" was some kind of Eskimo dog
She thought ""The Texas Troubadour's"" were President Johnsons stand
She even thought that ""Ernest Tubb"" was a sincere place to take a bath
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
Just to think that she'd been to college and travelled around the world
Then the nerve to ask me if ""Bobby Bare"" was a striptease girl
But what really got my goat and made me explode
Would you believe that she thought ""Jonny Cash"" was money you find in a commode
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
Man talk about being this, squirly ain't the word
Why she even thinks that ""Pete Drake"" is a duck
""Western Union"" is a cowboys underwear
I don't know what ... [ Fade ]

I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life
I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured pink champagne by candlelight
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say ""You know the rest""
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block till I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Lord you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried please put away that knife
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in the cell
But who taught who the cold hard facts of life
Who taught who the cold hard facts of life

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

[Verse 1]
What a crazy, crazy party, never seen so many people
Laughing, dancing, look at you, you're having fun
But look at me I'm almost crying
But that don't keep her love from dying
Misery, 'cause for me the party's over

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

[Verse 2]
Once I had a love undying, I didn't keep it wasn't trying
Life for me was just one party and then another
I broke her heart so many times, had to have my party wife
And then one night she said, ""Sweetheart, the party's over""

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

[Outro]
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

332,Dave Dudley,36,My Kind Of Love,1967,"

To your way of thinking a promise is easy to make
Cause to your kind of promise is nothing but something to break
And the laugh fits your lips honey like a hand fits the glove
And your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love
The heartaches you caused me don't cause you the least bit of shame
And I guess if I let you you'd hurt me all over again
And I can't help but wonder what was I thinking of
To think that your kind of woman could understand my kind of love
I made you my life while you made me into your fool
Yes I found that too late that your love meant heartache
Your kind of woman never could be true
But someday you'll know what a hurt when your heart breaks in two
And when your world falls to the pieces then you'll know what you put me through
And I hope I'm around when you'll learn what I'm speaking of
Cause your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love

333,The Statler Brothers,37,Ruthless,1967,"

Who always cooked my steaks and cooked 'em rare Ruth
When the chips were down who was always there Ruth
And to whom did I swear up and down I'd always tell the truth
E-del-o-da-la-de who in the world but Ruth
But now I'm as ruthless as can be ruthless since Ruth walked out to me
Now I had hopes that someday old Ruth would be my wife
But it looks like I'll be ruthless all my life
( whistle )
Who always made my world so bright and cheery ol' Ruth
Who always rubbed my back when I was weary sweet Ruth
Who used to call me every day from a telephone booth
E-del-o-da-la-de who in the world but Ruth
But now I'm as ruthless as can be ruthless since Ruth walked out to me
I used to think that me and Ruth would share a happy home
But it looks like I'll be ruthless from now on

334,Bobby Bare,38,Charleston Railroad Tavern,1967,"

Charleston Railroad Tavern sittin' up till I'm blind
She left on that 5-0-9 Eastern standard blue time

My baby left this evening I'd changed all this if I could
But her train just pulled out of sight I know she's gone for good

So Charleston Railroad Tavern...

I stayed out so many nights the crowd downtown was fun
But her love had turned to hate before I knew the harm I'd done

Now the laughing tavern crowd is gone I'm so lonesome I could die
The man just said it's closing time guess I'll go home and cry

So Charleston Railroad Tavern...

335,George Hamilton IV,39,Urge For Going,1967,"

I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row

I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win

But when the leaves fell on the ground
Boy winds came around
Pushed them face down in the snow

I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

Now the warriors of winter, they gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is camping out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow They got the urge for going And they got the wings so they can go

They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

I'm gonna wipe these teardrops from my eyes
There ain't no use for me to cry
And there's some things I think I need to say
I'll think about you every day, every day while you're away

I'll be true to you honey, while you're gone
If you're not gone too long
But if you're gone for a year or two
It may be too long for me to be true

I might find somebody else
'Cause I get lonesome by myself
I'll be the truest love you've known
And for a while I'll stay at home

I'll be true to you honey, while you're gone
If you're not gone too long
But if you're gone for a year or two
It may be too long for me to be true

Tomorrow you'll be gone I know
So love me now before you go
We don't know
What's farther down the road

There may be a detour sign
To upset plans of yours and mine
I'll be true to you honey, while you're gone
If you're not gone too long

But if you're gone for a year or two
It may be too long for me to be true

I might find somebody else
'Cause I get lonesome by myself
I'll be the truest love you've known
And for a while I'll stay at home

Oh yeah, if you're not gone too long...

Help help help stamp out loneliness bring back the happy that we had before
Let's all get together tonight and begin by lining the ladies up next to the men
Then two by two let's march day and night
Till loneliness leaves us and goes out of sight
Help help help stamp out loneliness help help help bring back the happiness
Help help help stamp out loneliness bring back the happy that we had before

Go search every tavern and nightspot in town
Cause that's where the most of the lonely are found
Tell them the lonely are meeting tonight
Come join in the start of the world's favorite fight
Help help help stamp out loneliness...

Now somewhere in your town this very night
There's broken hearts wishing with all of their might
That someone might lead them back to love's door
So they can be happy like they were before
Help help help stamp out loneliness...
Help help help stamp out loneliness...

Not so long ago I had my poor heart broken
I said crazy heart see what a fool you've been
Now I've met you and although we've barely spoken
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

I'm in love again and wedding bells are ringing
I'm so happy I'm afraid this dream might end
Live each day as though the last my heart keeps singing
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

[Instrumental Break]

When she left me I was sure my world had ended
And I couldn't even speak to our friends
And then just as my poor heart was getting mended
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

I'm in love again and wedding bells are ringing
I'm so happy I'm afraid this dream might end
Live each day as though the last my heart keeps singing
I hear wedding bells and I'm in love again

Kind friends you have heard the story
And the song called Twenty One Years
All of how two lovers parted
Of their sorrow, pain and tears

I am another who's heartbroken
And I'm in this lonesome jail
I was the honest ranger
Tried for fame but soon I failed

I was a cowboy singer
And I played the old guitar
But my mind was set on roaming
I started out for lands a-far

Soon fell with bad companions
And we robbed the Western mail
Shot and killed some helpless lady
As I think my face grows pale

I had a pretty sweet heart
And she though the world of me
But we parted at the station
Down in sunny Tennessee

Last night from her I got a letter
Saying, ""I can never be your bride""
As the moon shone though my window
I bowed my head and cried

Never more we'll stroll together;
Down in dear old Lover's Lane
I must spend my life in prison
I pray on high we'll meet again

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved

And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Told the boss I was going to my mother's
Told mama I was gonna see a friend
Don't want no one to know I'm slippin'
Out of town on a wild weekend

Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend

Well, we might go up to the mountains
We might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world
Just my baby and me

Baby's gonna cook me breakfast
Baby's gonna tuck me in
Baby's gonna warm my cold, cold lips
With kisses on a wild weekend

Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling
Gonna have a wild weekend

I guess we'll talk about the future
Make a lotta plans and stuff
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire
And make a lotta love

Every man oughta try it
Least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend
Like I'm gonna do with my wife

Gonna have a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children
Gonna have a wild weekend...

Don't get no attention from the people on street
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be

But I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need

Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford
People all around us with their noses in the air
They walk right on by us just like we're not even there

But I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need

I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care

I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime
I heard you whisper ""We'll meet again, another place, another time""
Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than lonley room of mine
Throug a lonely night a waitin' for
Another place, Another time

Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
I've been so used to holding you close to me
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonley room waiting for another place, another time
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room to wait for
Another Place, Another Time

352,Merle Haggard,6,The Legend Of Bonnie And Clyde,1968,"

[Verse]
Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie and Clyde
The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde
Two years or running was ended that day
For robbing and killing they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde
Bonnie and Clyde

Did you know your love had taken me that high?

Did you know your love had taken me that high
To the peaks of mountains reachin' to the sky
You took me inside of love, a site that I have never seen before
Did you know your love had taken me that high?

There's no use in my describin' all the hurtin' I've been hidin'
I've been makin' love to shadows, just your image in my mind
I still think of the first night we laid and held each other
I never knew love could take a man that high

Did you know your love had taken me that high
To the peaks of mountains reachin' to the sky
You took me inside of love, a site that I have never seen before
Did you know your love had taken me that high?

Did you know your love had taken me that high

You took me inside of love, a site that I have never seen before

I met her out in Oklahoma
Down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones

We walked alone down by the river
Just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble
Like the muddy waters down below

Her lips were soft and sweet as honey
Her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones

And then one day a tall dark stranger
With hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling
And there he met my Rosie Jones

I woke next morning just after sunup
To find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you
But I'm in love with that tall dark man

So now I walk alone down by the river
Where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters
For I can't live without Rosie Jones

Her lips were soft and sweet as honey
Her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones...

When you leave you'd better pack cause you ain't comin' back
There ain't gonna be no another time

Let me further explain what I'm a talkin' about three strikes baby and then you're out
You've already had two swings at the ball
There's just one more and I'm afraid that's all
Cause there ain't gonna be no another time...

I've always heard about the third time charm
And this is trip number three you've made to my arms
I hope you'll find what you're looking for
Cause I'm changing the lock on my front door
And there ain't gonna be no another time...
There ain't gonna be no another time...

That you've been a loving my man
But the man I love
When he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanta go to Fist City

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour round my town
Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground

I'm not a sayin' my baby is a saint cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

[Verse 2]
Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour round my town
Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground

[Intro]
We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto

[Chorus]
Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold onto?
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

[Verse 2]
We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long how hard we've tried

[Chorus]
Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold onto?
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

Well I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Well I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
[ guitar ]
We met by chance and I knew at a glance I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you if you just agree

And I'll give you love...
Yes love's something that money can't buy
Oh love's something that money can't buy

"
360,Faron Young,14,She Went A Little Bit Farther,1968,"

Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it so easy for me to love another
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
Where your love stopped she went a little bit farther
You changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger
It wasn't so hard our love was already in danger
She does everything that pleases me you never
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther
She went a little bit farther to make me feel love
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of
So don't blame her for stealing me you let her
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther

So don't blame her...
Where your love stopped she went a little bit farther

You say it's over, now
But it's easy to see
You still belong to him
You're not happy with me

You can hide all your feelings
Until he passes by
That's when I see the blues
In your pretty brown eyes

Your pretty brown eyes
Keep telling me lies
But they can't hide the hurt
With a smile of disguise

You can hide all your feelings
Until he passes by
That's when I see the blues
In your pretty brown eyes

Keep telling me lies

366,Tammy Wynette,20,D-I-V-O-R-C-E,1968,"

[Verse 1}
Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me

[Chorus]
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E; becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E

{Verse 2]
Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words
And turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt
That's drippin' down my cheek

[Chorus]
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E; becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E

367,Slim Whitman,21,Rainbows Are Back In Style,1968,"

Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learnin' how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you and rainbows are back in style
There's not a thing in this world I'd rather do to just sit, stare at your face
You're so pretty that you made the world a whole lot happier place
Well, life's worth livin' and the love you're givin'
Has made me feel this way and rainbows have chased the clouds away
Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learnin' how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you and rainbows are back in style
Well, your name is like music and I can't help singin' it over and over again
This happy feelin' has got me thinkin' it's heaven I'm livin' in
Well, the love we share puts magic in the air and every dream comes true
And rainbows have turned my skies to blue
Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere and I'm learnin' how to smile
The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you and rainbows are back in style

"
368,Roger Miller,22,Little Green Apples,1968,"

Well I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says 'hi'
Then I stumble to the breakfast table
Where the kids are going off to school, goodbye
Then she reaches out takes my hand and squeezes it
And says 'how you feeling hon'
Then I look across the smiling lips
That warms my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say
God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, or Disney Land
Or Mother Goose or nursery rhymes
God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in indianapolis in the summer time

And when myself is feeling low I think about her face aglow
To ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And asked her if she can get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples
And It don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs, or autumn leaves, no BB guns

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes

369,Dave Dudley,23,There Ain't No Easy Run,1968,"

I was sittin' in the terminal waitin' for my load
When a greenhorn driver came in off of the road
I heard him tell that foreman get my little pink slip
This run's too tough and I'm gonna quit
Now the foreman that day happened to be old Joe man he was older than time
He said son how long you been drivin' this rig
You know I drove all shapes forms fashions and kinds
Here you are worried about this one little trip
Why I drove a million miles and then some
He looked that greenhorn right in the eye and he said
""Boy there ain't no easy run""
I drove for Roadway, Interstate, Hopewell, Great Lakes
Overnight and Time, Mayflower and Freight Line
Specter, Yellow Transit, Western, and Gillete
Redball, Rider Northwestern, Big CF
Beaver & Bell, Hoover & McLeans
Gateway Motor Freight, Transport, Vikings
Dixie, Ohio, and Trans American Some
East Texas, Mason Dixon, Watkin and Transcon
Wilson Associate got all that drivin' done
And I'll tell you boy there ain't no easy runs

Now if you got a gal in Texas they'll send you up to Maine
If you got a gal in New York they'll send you out to the plains
I know what your problem is you got woman trouble son
Well like I said there ain't no easy run

I drove for Navajo, Brady, Goose, DC
North American, Allied, Chicago Motor Freight & Pie
Bee Mac & Curtis, Eastern and NX

And Yunhan and Buckingham got all that drivin' done
And I'll tell you boy there ain't no easy run
I went backward forwards uphill downhill chills spills thrills and pills...

And how about Atlas & Cramer
Alabama, Hiway Express, Murphy Line
And Long, and Harris, General Stickland, Eden & Key
How about that Nashville by-pass on a Friday afternoon
That'll blow yer shorts off
That's sumpin else
Then there's, Atlanta, Daily, McCrae, Wheeling, Rockwell, Gilbert

370,Jerry Reed,24,Remembering,1968,"

Every night I go down to this same little joint
Fill up my glass till I reach the point past remembering
Where the music is loud the conversation is free
A dance or two with someone to keep me from remembering
The fool I've been the hurt I've caused the good woman that I loved and lost
For she's constantly with me in memory
I go home but I couldn't sleep and after hours I'd be walkin' the streets remembering
A good woman's love is hard to find and my woman's love was just that kind
And I'm the reason that she's gone today
I miss her so and the price that I pay is remembering
I take her to sleep in my dreams every night
Then start all over in the morning light remebering
The way it was when she loved me then like a fool how I carelessly
Broke her heart then watched my world fall apart
I'd give this world for yesterday just to have her love me the way I remember
Just to have her love me the way I remember

"
371,Jimmy Dean,25,A Thing Called Love,1968,"

Six foot six, he stood on the ground
Weighed two hundred and thirty five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him a-cryin like a little whipped pup
Because of love

Can't see it with your eyes,hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world, turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been
Found that's stronger than love

Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their mind day in and day out
Too busy a livin to worry about a thing called love

But when I see a mother's tenderness as she holds
Her young close to her breast,then I thank God
This worlds been blessed with a thing called love

"
372,Marty Robbins,26,Love Is In The Air,1968,"

[Verse 1]
Way up yonder in the sky
Much higher than an eagle flies
I see a vapor trail that saddens me and tells a tale
A tale that tortures me within
And tells me
Love is in the air again

[Verse 2]
Way up yonder in the heaven
In a 727
In a uniform she wears
That leaves too much of her legs bare
That causes men to stare and stare
I'm helpless
Love is in the air

[Chorus]
I can’t make myself belief that her remarks are just made jokingly
I can't 'cause I recall the night we met the way she smiled and she said:
""Coffee, tea or me?""

[Verse 3]
While she’s up there on a flight
I cry here in my bed at night
Smoke cigarettes and walk the floor
Drink coffee, then I walk some more
I curse and cry in deep despair
I die each moment
Love is in the air

[Verse 4]
While she's up there on a flight
I cry here in my bed at night
Smoke cigarettes and walk the floor
Drink coffee, then I walk some more
I curse and cry in deep despair
I die each moment
Love is in the air

373,Dottie West,27,Country Girl,1968,"

You say you found it easy
Pleasing your country girl
Her simple way of living's
Brought real love to your world
You say you found it easy
Pleasing your country girl
Her simple way of living's brought real love to your world

A home cook meals her French cafe
A night with you
Her Broadway play
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl

You tell her she's a pleasure
And the treasure in your arms
You love her warm and tender
Unsophisticated charms

There's no diamonds in her wedding ring
Wear your name's her claim to fame
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl

[strings]

They say you have your choice of girls
Why picked a girl like me
Yet, you took me out to places
For all your friends to see

You held my hand and called me dear
Your nights have always been sincere
And it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl
Yes, it really makes me happy
Knowing I'm your country girl

377,Billy Walker,31,Sundown Mary,1968,"

I first met Sundown Mary  a year ago today
Traveling the same road I was  going the other way
We talked and then she said you might be nice to have around
If you don't mind a laying your head wherever the sun goes down

I've always been a loner never had no one before
But with every town we passed through I loved her a little more
And one night when I kissed her I thought she felt the same
But then the spell was broken by the whistle of a train

What have you heard from Sundown Mary what has she done today
Is she eating her food from the silver spoon and off of the golden plate
Is she in the chips in Texas or stranded broke in Maine
Do you know if Sundown Mary ever speaks my name
Ever speaks my name

We hopped a train to Baton Rouge the trip took several days
I had no idea that she thought of going separate ways
There in the crowded station she softly spoke my name
And said it's time to leave you cause I come and go like rain

There's not much left of what you'd call the man I used to be
For in her place an empty space haunts my memory
Always broke and lonely I age a year a day
And when I get to drinking nights there's just one thing I say

What have you heard from Sundown Mary what has she done today
Is she eating her food from the silver spoon and off of the golden plate
Is she in the chips in Texas or stranded broke in Maine
Do you know if Sundown Mary ever speaks my name
Ever speaks my name

The easy part's over now and the hard part begins

A dollar an hour, eight hours a day
Will soon make a young man wither away
I work for my family with my wrinkled hands
For I'm a small time laboring man
Six long days each week I toil and I sweat
But on Sunday my family gives me comfort and rest
Then again Monday morning I'll make tracks in the sand
For I'm a small time laboring man
I'm a small time laboring man
Fighting against trying as hard as I can
I fight for my country with my caloused hands
For I'm a small time laboring man
Twelve long months each year my life stays the same
Making my honest dollar in the sun, snow and rain
No, you don't see my family on the starvation plan
For I'm a small time laboring man...

Breaking down a heart that only he could mend

Your smiles are my pearls and your ruby lips are beyond compare
Your eyes are my diamonds and my gold is the gold in your hair
Earth has its treasure of fabulous wealth untold
And who can measure the treasure the oceans hold
But whether it be underneath the sea or the sky above
There is no treasure like the treasure of your love

There was a time when I thought I could find happiness in silver and gold
And I longed for fame and wordly acclaim
And I've hungered for these things filled my very soul
But then you came along and now I know I was wrong
For in your eyes I can see the greatest treasure in all the world
The treasure of your love for me
Earth has its treasure...

Games People Play
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now

Never saying what they mean

In their ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

La da da da da la da da dada dee
I'm talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry

Break their hearts and they say goodbye
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one would ever give in

So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the ways it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

[Chorus]
People walkin' up to you
Singin' glory hallelujah
And they try to send it you
In the Name of the Lord

Oh they teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
And the further more the hell with hate
Come on and get on board

[Chorus]
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

'Cause you're givin' up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
Whoa and you don't give a dah dah dah

And I'm throwin' away my happiness by leaving you
Well, it's my life, throw it away if I want to

And soothe his ego
I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
But it's my life, throw it away if I want to

You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight and filling up my mind
With a little bits of guilt you think I oughta feel
Well I'm tired of feeling guilty and I'm tired of having nothing
And I'm throwin' away this life you've had me shackled to
It's my life, throw it away if I want to

My names in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy’s bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife’s in the kitchen and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn

And I know why she’s there I’ve been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldn’t cheat anymore
I try to ignore it but I know she’s in there my friend
My mind’s on a number and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn

Next Sunday it’s my turn to speak to the young peoples' class
And they expect answers to all the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin?
And all of the Margie’s and all of the Lincoln Park Inns

The bike is all fixed and my little boy’s in bed asleep
His little warm puppy is curled in a ball at my feet
My wife’s baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again
I’m almost out of cigarettes and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she’s there

I left Garden City Kansas with a ticket and a yen to see New York
I typed eigty words a minute so your corporation let me go to work
I fetch paper clips and coffee even help you dodge your domineering wife
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

In this building there's a crowd of guys with old familiar thoughts upon their minds
That's a lot of hands a reaching out you grab the things that I consider mine
And the president persues me even though he's old and hair a turnin' white
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

There's a flat in Greenwich Village that I took because the subway wasn't far
But a trumpet player's upstairs and below me ther's a jumping all night bar
And to frost a bitter cake I have to share the place with bugs and big ol' mice
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

Your sweetheart in personnel said I should give her written notice like the rest
So I wrote goodbye with my brightest lipstick right across her big expensive desk
You'd better call the Times and tell 'em put your wanted ad right back in classified
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

There's a Greyhound at the station and a mom at home with open arms for me
Garden City's looking better every minute now since I have learned to see
And the boy next door don't know it but come June he's gonna gain himself a wife
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

Your world was so different
From mine don't you see
We just couldn't be close
Though we tried

We both reached for heavens
But ours weren't the same
That's what happens
When two worlds collide

Your world was made up
Of things sweet and good
My world could never
Fit in, wish it could

Two hearts lie in shambles
And oh. how they've cried
That's what happens
When two worlds collide

404,Jeannie C. Riley,8,There Never Was A Time,1969,"

There was a time
We'd sit in the backyard 'cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun
There was no way of sleeping
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy

You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life
As man and wife and hardships then
Could scarcely scare us into quitting

Things were far from being fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

And that Christmas brought our saddest days
When your pride gave way when you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief were so hard to see
It didn't hurt me

Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined
We both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love

Now there's an easy chair for my back
A satin pillow for my head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry

If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers
We've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of raising kids and paying bills

And I think he guided us
Not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time
There never was a time we didn't love

(Les Reed - J. Rae)

Please don't go, I beg you don't go
For I need you here with me
If we part down deep in my heart
I know what the end will be

No one else can take your place
The love that I have known
If I don't see your sweet face
My life I'll live alone

Stay here with me
That's the way it should be
The world can see
That I can't set you free

Just this once I beg you this once
Forgive for what I've done
I adore you, I was meant for you
Much more than anyone

Darling, I love you so
More than you seemed to know
Say you would meet
Please don't go...

One more mile one more detour that's the way goes tears and smiles
I may miss you and I may wish that I have stayed but I'll be movin' it one more mile
And then one more I gotta keep moving I was born a traveling child
It's my way and it's the nature of my mind I gotta keep doggin' it one more mile

Storms won't stop me wind won't do it a little rough ride that fits my style
When the sun sets in the window of your world I'll be draggin' it one more mile
And then one more I gotta keep moving...
(One more mile)
One more mile one more detour...

409,Doug Kershaw With Hank Williams  Jr.,13,Cajun Baby,1969,
410,Sonny James,14,Running Bear,1969,"

[Verse 1:]
On the bank of the river stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be

[Chorus:]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die
He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground

[Chorus:]

411,Merle Haggard,15,Hungry Eyes,1969,"

[Verse 1]
A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
Stand out in this memory I revived
Because my daddy raised a family there, with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes
He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

[Chorus]
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes

[Verse 2]
I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes

[Chorus]
Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes
Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes

I want you more than anything in the world
You mean more to me than any other girl
Now he's with you and things you do with him
We've done them for so long
I love you more today, than he can from now on

I've kissed your tears away when you were sad
Held you close, felt your warm love when you were glad
So, no matter how much love he has for you or how long
I love you more today, than he can from now on

We've already done the things he plans to do
So don't be surprised if late at night
I'm in your dreams with you
And if someday his love for goes wrong
I love you more today, than he can from now on

I love you more today, than he can from now on...

Galveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was twenty-one when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Galveston, oh Galveston, I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun
At Galveston, at Galveston

That lives on and on be yours love

May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love

May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love

And from this moment on may a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love

Every time it rains Lard I run to my window
All I do is ring my hands and moan
Listen to that thunder roll and I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long you been gone so long now
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Wolf is scratching at my door and I can hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Someone said they thought they saw you roaring down in Reno
With a big oil man from San Antone
They tell me I'm a fool to pine for you but what do they know
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long...
There ain't nothing I wanna do oh I guess I could get stoned
And let the past paint pictures on my head
Kill a fifth of Thunderbird and try to write a sad song
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
Tell me baby why you been gone so long...
Tell me baby why you been gone so long

419,Mel Tillis,23,Old Faithful,1969,"

I always called her old faithful she was always there when I came home
And I never thought the day would come she'd leave me
But for me those kind of thinking days are gone
Cause old faithful ain't faithful anymore she's stepping out to even up the score
She's out there where the lights are bright wineing dining every night
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore

Night after night she sits waitin' just to touch the fool that she loves so
But now for her those waiting days are over
For absence makes the warmest heart grow cold
Cause old faithful ain't faithful...
And old faithful ain't faithful anymore

Now that it's over and done
Well, that's something to think about
And I've already begun
I suppose that I'll find a way
People usually do
Well, it's something to think about
I'll be lost without you
One thing I would have you do
Please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonelier years
When youth an' beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have
Any sweetheart that you choose
Here's something to think about
I'll still be thinking of you
One thing I would have you do
Please consider the dawn
The dawn of your lonelier years
When youth an' beauty are gone
And when you can no longer have
Any sweetheart you choose
Here's something to think about
I'll still be thinkin' of you

422,Bobby Goldsboro,26,I'm A Drifter,1969,"

You knew I could not stay for long when you asked me
To come over in the wee hours of the mornin

I said I could not let the sunrise catch me sleepin
And that is why I've givin you fair warnin

And though you might have loved me like I never ever have been
Loved before your front door is open
And I've got to keep on movin

So I will stay with you a while and then I'll
Let my hitch hike thumb take me to where I wanna

Because I've got to keep on searchin for the dream that I've been seekin
Since I left my home in Oklahoma

And who's to say but that I might not be back tomorrow
If I find there's only sorrow you may see me from your windowsill
Next mornin

I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain, the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow

Lets make the most of time before the break of day
But don't try to make me stay if I don't want to

Because I've got to keep on searchin for that dream
And you can't bind me with the simple words I love you

But if I realize the dream that I've been searchin for
Is waitin here behind your door
Then I'll come back to stay if you still want me to

I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow

I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow

I'm a drifter 'fade

I've been a watchin' your big flirty eyes how they water when my baby walks by
And I ain't a takin' to your way of thinkin' while you're checkin' out my behalf

Now I ain't a teasin' quite messin' with my pleasin' and leave my dream alone

So you'd better part with messin' with my heart and leave my dream alone

Stop messin' round where you don't belong

Stop messin' round where you don't belong

424,Jack Greene,28,Statue Of A Fool,1969,"

Somewhere there should be for all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
An image of a man who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone

And there on his face, a gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show, so everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside

So, build a statue and oh build it high so that all can see
Then inscribe: The World's Greatest Fool, and name it after me

Sharing love stolen in the night in smoky places

The end has come and found us here
With our toys scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found an answer for
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for
And here we stand in a box of sand

Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

The carousel has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
And still you're not content with something about me
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me
To take your hand?
How would you stand?

Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?

Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?

Another day is over
Hard work and play comes to an end
Evening shadows grow long and strong
As the dawn of night begins

Supper's over, prayers are said
The kids are tucked in and that's when
Gentle arms serve me love and peace of mind
It's man and wife time

I lay beside her and I realize
I am such a lucky man
For I've got everything that life
Has to offer in my hands

And I'm happy deep within
As I hold her in my hands
And she knows she's mine and only mine
At man and wife time

God has given me an angel for my very own
And she's brought a bit of heaven to my life
She's filled our home with love
She's taught our children right from wrong
And loved me so completely as my wife

The years go by like hours
And silver creeps into her hair
But the love in her eyes survives
Never dies, it's always there

Reassuring, telling me time has handled
With care what we share
And heaven can't offer more than what I find
At man and wife time

Man and wife time
Man and wife time

Ribbon of darkness over me since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds're gathering o'er my head they chill the day and hide the sun
And shroud the night when day is done ribbon of darkness over me
Rain is fallin' on the meadow where once my love and I did lie
Now he is gone from the meadow my love goodbye
Ribbon of darkness over me where once the world was young as spring
Where clouds're bloomin' birds were would sing ribbon of darkness over me

In this cold room lying don't wanna see no one but you
Lord I wish I could be dying to forget you
How I wish your heart could see my mind just takes the breaks of day
Come on back and take away ribbon of darkness over me
La da da da dee de dee la da da da dee de dee
Hmm hmm hmm ribbon of darkness over me

You don't really love him
You're playing 'round for fun
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

[Chorus]
You're the devil's woman
That's what my man don't know
Why I wear more in swimming
Than you wear to parties where you go
There's a place I know where you should go
For that's where you belong
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

I don't know about the things
The bright lights taught to you
My country boy don't know them
Any better than I do
I'll have to watch him hurting
After you are gone
Woman of the world, leave my world alone

You're the devil's woman

Or before you know it you'll be all alone

Take care what you do when you do if you do it
If you don't you won't have your baby long
Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone

Everybody envies you you lucky so and so
You should thank your lucky stars above
Just what she sees in you I guess I'll never know
It's a wonder you still have her love

Be glad you've got...

You'd better treat her better you'd better start right now
She deserves the best that you can do
She does everything for you the best that she knows how
That's the least she can expect from you

Be glad you've got...

Deep down in Lousiana, close to New Orleans
Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never, ever learned to read or write, so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go, go, go, Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, Johnny B Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy could play
Go, go, go, Johnny go, go
Go, Johnny go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, Johnny B Goode

--- Instrumental ---

His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
A sayin' Johnny B Goode tonight
Go, go, go, Johnny go, go
Go, Johnny go, go, go, Johnny go
Go, go, Johnny B Goode...

Trying to be a good mother and wife
And she stood by you when the rest let you down
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now?

She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew
While Mama's are withered from working for you

And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way

What is truth?

What is truth?

Little Red Parker was way in the back taking quarters and hadling racks
And I told him Red come up here glue 'em up tight
That brandy had me feeling warm I tipped that waitress and I checked her form
And I said honey you like a winner and she just smiled
I played like a man with a broken wrist I won two and he won six
And I had him set up so I said let's play for five
But this time the crowd had gathered round to see this fish and just watch him drown
I told that waitress more brandy water by
Then he went out and got a custom cue he said it's no offence to you
But I don't play off the wall with nobody but friends
He had a gold initials in a leather grip pearly and silver inlaid tip
He smiled at me and he said hell-a-way we play for ten
Well I never seen a man that walk who made those balls and table talk
They're speaking English he sure didn't need my help
He broke the ball and kept that string for a hundred and eighty seven bucks and a ring
Till I gave up and said friend you're gonna have to play by yourself
Well he racked it up and walked outside and I strolled out just to watch him ride
And there was a blonde in their Caddy built like the rest of that car
The boys in the poolroom they had 'em a laugh and I hung it up and just let it pass
And had nothin' but my elbows to put on the bar
And the waitress smiled said water by I took the chairity and thanked her polite
And sittin' there sippin' and suddenly I had me a thought
Unlucky gambler and lucky in love guess you know what I was thinking of
When I said waitress honey what time do you get off

452,Charley Pride,6,Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone,1970,"

Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat
Sure is cold today
Here I am walkin' down 66
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleepin' under a table in a roadside park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin' in my king sized bed
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is all right as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her?
Wind creepin' down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothin' on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fightin' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the U.S. Mail
People writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll be just as gone
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is all right as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her?

[Verse 1:]
Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama
I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land
A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand
Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man
Well I can sing I can dance I can play the harmonica too
I got a brand new thing on the South Side Montgomery Blues
You better stick around and watch me cause I'm an entertainin' fool

Well I learned my trade from that rag-poppin' daddy o'mine
He shined twelve alligators made a hundred dollar bill one time
And when the meat gets scarce I shine two or three pairs for a dime

I had a girl that helped me she had a lotta hoochy coochy ways
She was bumping and grinding paid that girl a dollar a day
But she was shy on age and the law come and took her away

455,Merle Haggard,9,Street Singer,1970,"

[Intro - Spoken]
Let me tell you about a song
That was brought to me by a good friend of mine who's a good songwriter
And every time he brings me a song I'm always willing to listen
But the story and the reasons for writing this song
Were even more interesting to me than the song
The old friend and fellow I'm speaking of is Tommy Collins
Tommy told me about an experience he had when he was a minister
Where he was called to preach a funeral for a man with no identity
Tommy said he never forgot the way he felt
Like here is a human being who someone must have loved at sometime
And yet there was no one present to pay respect
Just a couple of grave diggers a funeral man and Tommy
Then the story switched to another thought bout during his last visit to Nashville
He went down to listen to an ole street singer
That he always made a point to go hear each time he was in town
And it was then that Tommy discovered
That Jack Dupree the ole street singer had passed away
And Tommy said he wondered how many were present at Jack's funeral
And it was these two true to life incidents that inspired this song

[Verse]
I only saw five people when they buried Jack Dupree
Two diggers and the preacher the funeral man and me
The pray was said and the hole was filled in less than half an hour
And I said goodbye to the little man who picked the wildwood flower
For twenty years I'd seen him on the lower Nashville streets
They said he always earned enough to buy his clothes and eats
He'd stop awhile and check his watch with the big clock on the tower
That's when I asked him once if he could pick the wildwood flower
He always drew a crowd because he put on such a show
He'd dance and sing and play and smile just like a polished pro
And every time he saw me standing in the crowd
I knew the tune that he'd play next would be the wildwood flower
I told him once that he could be what people call a star
And he said why boy I'm happy how many of them folks are
I'd hate to have to force a smile and feel myself turn sour
There ain't no put on in my face when I pick the wildwood flower
Then I saw a thousand people as they begin to come
Business men and opry stars party girls and bums
And on that little mound of clay bouquets begin to shower
As they paid respect to the little man who picked the wildwood flower

I love you so much that I can't leave you even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think you really want me
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good
You've got me heart over mind worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You keep hurting me I know but I just can't let you go
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Now friends tell me they see you out with others and in my heart I try hard to forget
But you come home and tell me you still love me
And I still hope there's some chance for us yet
You've got me heart over mind...
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Little children, do not worry cause you still got lots of time
There's no need in walking backwards, turn around and rise and shine
If your load always seems heavy, and you're always left behind
Pick yourself up from the ground, and jump right back and rise and shine

Rise and shine in the early morning, shine your light on through the day
Makes no diff'rence what they tell you, stand right up and have your say
'Cause the good Lord said He loves you, and through Him your strength you'll find --
Even though the world may use you, turn around and rise and shine
( ac.guitar - trumpet )
Look at how they did poor Jesus, why, they nailed Him to a cross
But He died up there on Calv'ry so the world would not be lost
So don't matter how they treat you, if they slap you in the face
Just remember Jesus loves you, and on the Cross He took your place

Rise and shine in the early morning, shine your light on through the day
Makes no diff'rence what they tell you, stand right up and have your say
'Cause the good Lord says He loves you, and through Him your strength you'll find
Even though the world may use you, get out now, go rise and shine

Rise and shine in the early morning . .

I've been up and I've been down I've worked the fields I've plowed the ground
I've taken strain and pressure till I thought I might explode
Now I yearn for childhood days of model planes and lemonade
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road bout a million miles or so
When you're just a child there ain't no time but now
Must have left that long old road seven hundred years ago
And I'd find it once again if I knew how

I've worked in city factories their plastic dirt still clings to me
Monotory near killed me Lord it was a heavy load
Now I dream of comic books and horny toads and fishin' hooks
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...

So I watch the children play and dream my dreams of yesterday
Don't tell them to be grateful I'm sure that they've been told
If I knew then what I know now that would have messed it up somehow
When the day stretched out before me like a long long Texas road
Yes a long long Texas road...

And you head right straight for a bar and a bottle
And try your best to crawl inside

Please stay there 'til I get there and we'll work it out together
We'll take a little walk and have a little talk
And you'll feel a whole lot better

Just when I wonder if you're really worth the trouble that you put me through
Then you roll them baby blue eyes at me
And jump like a kangaroo
Stay there 'til I get there...

Well I thought about leavin' you many times
And I've even packed my bags a few
Then the telephone rings and I can't do a thing
But run right straight to you

Baby stay there 'til I get there...

With love that strengthens my life

Take away the trees and the birds
All have to sit upon the ground, uum

The birds will have to walk to get around
And take away the bird baths
And dirty birds will soon be ev'rywhere
Take away their feathers and
The birds will walk around in underwear
Take away their chirp and the
Birds will have to whisper when they sing
And take away their common sense and
They'll be headed southward in the spring

Oh remember my darling
When spring is in the air
And the bald headed birds
Are whisp'ring ev'rywhere
You can see them walking
Southward in their dirty underwear
That's Tennessee Bird walk

How about some trees so the birds

Won't have to sit upon the ground, uum
How about some wings so the
Birds won't have to walk to get around
And how about a bird bath or two

How about some feathers so their
Underwear no longer can be seen
How about a chirp so the birds
Won't have to whisper when they sing
And how about some common sense so they
Won't be blocking traffic in the spring

Southward in their dirty underwear

472,John Wesley Ryles  I,26,I've Just Been Wasting My Time,1970,"

Sometimes I’ll glimpse my reflection in a window and feel astonished by what I see. Jet-black hair. Slanted eyes. A pancake-flat surface of yellow-and-green-toned skin. An expression that is nearly reptilian in its impassivity. I’ve contrived to think of this face as the equal in beauty to any other. But what I feel in these moments is its strangeness to me. It’s my face. I can’t disclaim it. But what does it have to do with me?

Millions of Americans must feel estranged from their own faces. But every self-estranged individual is estranged in his own way. I, for instance, am the child of Korean immigrants, but I do not speak my parents’ native tongue. I have never called my elders by the proper honorific, “big brother” or “big sister.” I have never dated a Korean woman. I don’t have a Korean friend. Though I am an immigrant, I have never wanted to strive like one.

You could say that I am, in the gently derisive parlance of Asian-Americans, a banana or a Twinkie (yellow on the outside, white on the inside). But while I don’t believe our roots necessarily define us, I do believe there are racially inflected assumptions wired into our neural circuitry that we use to sort through the sea of faces we confront. And although I am in most respects devoid of Asian characteristics, I do have an Asian face.

Here is what I sometimes suspect my face signifies to other Americans: an invisible person, barely distinguishable from a mass of faces that resemble it. A conspicuous person standing apart from the crowd and yet devoid of any individuality. An icon of so much that the culture pretends to honor but that it in fact patronizes and exploits. Not just people “who are good at math” and play the violin, but a mass of stifled, repressed, abused, conformist quasi-robots who simply do not matter, socially or culturally.

I’ve always been of two minds about this sequence of stereotypes. On the one hand, it offends me greatly that anyone would think to apply them to me, or to anyone else, simply on the basis of facial characteristics. On the other hand, it also seems to me that there are a lot of Asian people to whom they apply.

Let me summarize my feelings toward Asian values: Fuck filial piety. Fuck grade-grubbing. Fuck Ivy League mania. Fuck deference to authority. Fuck humility and hard work. Fuck harmonious relations. Fuck sacrificing for the future. Fuck earnest, striving middle-class servility.

I understand the reasons Asian parents have raised a generation of children this way. Doctor, lawyer, accountant, engineer: These are good jobs open to whoever works hard enough. What could be wrong with that pursuit? Asians graduate from college at a rate higher than any other ethnic group in America, including whites. They earn a higher median family income than any other ethnic group in America, including whites. This is a stage in a triumphal narrative, and it is a narrative that is much shorter than many remember. Two thirds of the roughly 14 million Asian-Americans are foreign-born. There were less than 39,000 people of Korean descent living in America in 1970, when my elder brother was born. There are around 1 million today.

Asian-American success is typically taken to ratify the American Dream and to prove that minorities can make it in this country without handouts. Still, an undercurrent of racial panic always accompanies the consideration of Asians, and all the more so as China becomes the destination for our industrial base and the banker controlling our burgeoning debt. But if the armies of Chinese factory workers who make our fast fashion and iPads terrify us, and if the collective mass of high-­achieving Asian-American students arouse an anxiety about the laxity of American parenting, what of the Asian-American who obeyed everything his parents told him? Does this person really scare anyone?

Earlier this year, the publication of Amy Chua’s Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother incited a collective airing out of many varieties of race-based hysteria. But absent from the millions of words written in response to the book was any serious consideration of whether Asian-Americans were in fact taking over this country. If it is true that they are collectively dominating in elite high schools and universities, is it also true that Asian-Americans are dominating in the real world? My strong suspicion was that this was not so, and that the reasons would not be hard to find. If we are a collective juggernaut that inspires such awe and fear, why does it seem that so many Asians are so readily perceived to be, as I myself have felt most of my life, the products of a timid culture, easily pushed around by more assertive people, and thus basically invisible?

A few months ago, I received an e-mail from a young man named Jefferson Mao, who after attending Stuyvesant High School had recently graduated from the University of Chicago. He wanted my advice about “being an Asian writer.” This is how he described himself: “I got good grades and I love literature and I want to be a writer and an intellectual; at the same time, I’m the first person in my family to go to college, my parents don’t speak English very well, and we don’t own the apartment in Flushing that we live in. I mean, I’m proud of my parents and my neighborhood and what I perceive to be my artistic potential or whatever, but sometimes I feel like I’m jumping the gun a generation or two too early.”

One bright, cold Sunday afternoon, I ride the 7 train to its last stop in Flushing, where the storefront signs are all written in Chinese and the sidewalks are a slow-moving river of impassive faces. Mao is waiting for me at the entrance of the Main Street subway station, and together we walk to a nearby Vietnamese restaurant.

Mao has a round face, with eyes behind rectangular wire-frame glasses. Since graduating, he has been living with his parents, who emigrated from China when Mao was 8 years old. His mother is a manicurist; his father is a physical therapist’s aide. Lately, Mao has been making the familiar hour-and-a-half ride from Flushing to downtown Manhattan to tutor a white Stuyvesant freshman who lives in Tribeca. And what he feels, sometimes, in the presence of that amiable young man is a pang of regret. Now he understands better what he ought to have done back when he was a Stuyvesant freshman: “Worked half as hard and been twenty times more successful.”

Entrance to Stuyvesant, one of the most competitive public high schools in the country, is determined solely by performance on a test: The top 3.7 percent of all New York City students who take the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test hoping to go to Stuyvesant are accepted. There are no set-asides for the underprivileged or, conversely, for alumni or other privileged groups. There is no formula to encourage “diversity” or any nebulous concept of “well-­roundedness” or “character.” Here we have something like pure meritocracy. This is what it looks like: Asian-­Americans, who make up 12.6 percent of New York City, make up 72 percent of the high school.

This year, 569 Asian-Americans scored high enough to earn a slot at Stuyvesant, along with 179 whites, 13 Hispanics, and 12 blacks. Such dramatic overrepresentation, and what it may be read to imply about the intelligence of different groups of New Yorkers, has a way of making people uneasy. But intrinsic intelligence, of course, is precisely what Asians don’t believe in. They believe—and have ­proved—that the constant practice of test-taking will improve the scores of whoever commits to it. All throughout Flushing, as well as in Bayside, one can find “cram schools,” or storefront academies, that drill students in test preparation after school, on weekends, and during summer break. “Learning math is not about learning math,” an instructor at one called Ivy Prep was quoted in the New York Times as saying. “It’s about weightlifting. You are pumping the iron of math.” Mao puts it more specifically: “You learn quite simply to nail any standardized test you take.”

And so there is an additional concern accompanying the rise of the Tiger Children, one focused more on the narrowness of the educational experience a non-Asian child might receive in the company of fanatically preprofessional Asian students. Jenny Tsai, a student who was elected president of her class at the equally competitive New York public school Hunter College High School, remembers frequently hearing that “the school was becoming too Asian, that they would be the downfall of our school.” A couple of years ago, she revisited this issue in her senior thesis at Harvard, where she interviewed graduates of elite public schools and found that the white students regarded the Asians students with wariness. (She quotes a music teacher at Stuyvesant describing the dominance of Asians: “They were mediocre kids, but they got in because they were coached.”) In 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported on “white flight” from a high school in Cupertino, California, that began soon after the children of Asian software engineers had made the place so brutally competitive that a B average could place you in the bottom third of the class.

Colleges have a way of correcting for this imbalance: The Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade has calculated that an Asian applicant must, in practice, score 140 points higher on the SAT than a comparable white applicant to have the same chance of admission. This is obviously unfair to the many qualified Asian individuals who are punished for the success of others with similar faces. Upper-middle-class white kids, after all, have their own elite private schools, and their own private tutors, far more expensive than the cram schools, to help them game the education system.

You could frame it, as some aggrieved Asian-Americans do, as a simple issue of equality and press for race-blind quantitative admissions standards. In 2006, a decade after California passed a voter initiative outlawing any racial engineering at the public universities, Asians composed 46 percent of UC-Berkeley’s entering class; one could imagine a similar demographic reshuffling in the Ivy League, where Asian-Americans currently make up about 17 percent of undergraduates. But the Ivies, as we all know, have their own private institutional interests at stake in their admissions choices, including some that are arguably defensible. Who can seriously claim that a Harvard University that was 72 percent Asian would deliver the same grooming for elite status its students had gone there to receive?

Somewhere near the middle of his time at Stuyvesant, a vague sense of discontent started to emerge within Mao. He had always felt himself a part of a mob of “nameless, faceless Asian kids,” who were “like a part of the décor of the place.” He had been content to keep his head down and work toward the goal shared by everyone at Stuyvesant: Harvard. But around the beginning of his senior year, he began to wonder whether this march toward academic success was the only, or best, path.

“You can’t help but feel like there must be another way,” he explains over a bowl of phô. “It’s like, we’re being pitted against each other while there are kids out there in the Midwest who can do way less work and be in a garage band or something—and if they’re decently intelligent and work decently hard in school …”

Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. “The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.

“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society. It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had—“a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list—and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life. “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.

Before having heard from Mao, I had considered myself at worst lightly singed by the last embers of Asian alienation. Indeed, given all the incredibly hip Asian artists and fashion designers and so forth you can find in New York, it seemed that this feeling was destined to die out altogether. And yet here it was in a New Yorker more than a dozen years my junior. While it may be true that sections of the Asian-American world are devoid of alienation, there are large swaths where it is as alive as it has ever been.

A few weeks after we meet, Mao puts me in touch with Daniel Chu, his close friend from Stuyvesant. Chu graduated from Williams College last year, having won a ­creative-writing award for his poetry. He had spent a portion of the $18,000 prize on a trip to China, but now he is back living with his parents in Brooklyn Chinatown.

Chu remembers that during his first semester at Williams, his junior adviser would periodically take him aside. Was he feeling all right? Was something the matter? “I was acclimating myself to the place,” he says. “I wasn’t totally happy, but I wasn’t depressed.” But then his new white friends made similar remarks. “They would say, ‘Dan, it’s kind of hard, sometimes, to tell what you’re thinking.’ ”

Chu has a pleasant face, but it would not be wrong to characterize his demeanor as reserved. He speaks in a quiet, unemphatic voice. He doesn’t move his features much. He attributes these traits to the atmosphere in his household. “When you grow up in a Chinese home,” he says, “you don’t talk. You shut up and listen to what your parents tell you to do.”

At Stuyvesant, he had hung out in an exclusively Asian world in which friends were determined by which subway lines you traveled. But when he arrived at Williams, Chu slowly became aware of something strange: The white people in the New England wilderness walked around smiling at each other. “When you’re in a place like that, everyone is friendly.”

He made a point to start smiling more. “It was something that I had to actively practice,” he says. “Like, when you have a transaction at a business, you hand over the money—and then you smile.” He says that he’s made some progress but that there’s still plenty of work that remains. “I’m trying to undo eighteen years of a Chinese upbringing. Four years at Williams helps, but only so much.” He is conscious of how his father, an IT manager, is treated at work. “He’s the best programmer at his office,” he says, “but because he doesn’t speak English well, he is always passed over.”

Though Chu is not merely fluent in En­glish but is officially the most distinguished poet of his class at Williams, he still worries that other aspects of his demeanor might attract the same kind of treatment his father received. “I’m really glad we’re having this conversation,” he says at one point—it is helpful to be remembering these lessons in self-presentation just as he prepares for job interviews.

It is a part of the bitter undercurrent of Asian-American life that meritocracy comes to an abrupt end after graduation.
“I guess what I would like is to become so good at something that my social deficiencies no longer matter,” he tells me. Chu is a bright, diligent, impeccably credentialed young man born in the United States. He is optimistic about his ability to earn respect in the world. But he doubts he will ever feel the same comfort in his skin that he glimpsed in the people he met at Williams. That kind of comfort, he says—“I think it’s generations away.”

While he was still an electrical-­engineering student at Berkeley in the nineties, James Hong visited the IBM campus for a series of interviews. An older Asian researcher looked over Hong’s résumé and asked him some standard questions. Then he got up without saying a word and closed the door to his office.

“Listen,” he told Hong, “I’m going to be honest with you. My generation came to this country because we wanted better for you kids. We did the best we could, leaving our homes and going to graduate school not speaking much English. If you take this job, you are just going to hit the same ceiling we did. They just see me as an Asian Ph.D., never management potential. You are going to get a job offer, but don’t take it. Your generation has to go farther than we did, otherwise we did everything for nothing.”

The researcher was talking about what some refer to as the “Bamboo Ceiling”—an invisible barrier that maintains a pyramidal racial structure throughout corporate America, with lots of Asians at junior levels, quite a few in middle management, and virtually none in the higher reaches of leadership.

The failure of Asian-Americans to become leaders in the white-collar workplace does not qualify as one of the burning social issues of our time. But it is a part of the bitter undercurrent of Asian-American life that so many Asian graduates of elite universities find that meritocracy as they have understood it comes to an abrupt end after graduation. If between 15 and 20 percent of every Ivy League class is Asian, and if the Ivy Leagues are incubators for the country’s leaders, it would stand to reason that Asians would make up some corresponding portion of the leadership class.

And yet the numbers tell a different story. According to a recent study, Asian-­Americans represent roughly 5 percent of the population but only 0.3 percent of corporate officers, less than 1 percent of corporate board members, and around 2 percent of college presidents. There are nine Asian-American CEOs in the Fortune 500. In specific fields where Asian-Americans are heavily represented, there is a similar asymmetry. A third of all software engineers in Silicon Valley are Asian, and yet they make up only 6 percent of board members and about 10 percent of corporate officers of the Bay Area’s 25 largest companies. At the National Institutes of Health, where 21.5 percent of tenure-track scientists are Asians, only 4.7 percent of the lab or branch directors are, according to a study conducted in 2005. One succinct evocation of the situation appeared in the comments section of a website called Yellowworld: “If you’re East Asian, you need to attend a top-tier university to land a good high-paying gig. Even if you land that good high-paying gig, the white guy with the pedigree from a mediocre state university will somehow move ahead of you in the ranks simply because he’s white.”

Jennifer W. Allyn, a managing director for diversity at PricewaterhouseCoopers, works to ensure that “all of the groups feel welcomed and supported and able to thrive and to go as far as their talents will take them.” I posed to her the following definition of parity in the corporate workforce: If the current crop of associates is 17 percent Asian, then in fourteen years, when they have all been up for partner review, 17 percent of those who are offered partner will be Asian. Allyn conceded that PricewaterhouseCoopers was not close to reaching that benchmark anytime soon—and that “nobody else is either.”

Part of the insidious nature of the Bamboo Ceiling is that it does not seem to be caused by overt racism. A survey of Asian-Pacific-American employees of Fortune 500 companies found that 80 percent reported they were judged not as Asians but as individuals. But only 51 percent reported the existence of Asians in key positions, and only 55 percent agreed that their firms were fully capitalizing on the talents and perspectives of Asians.

More likely, the discrepancy in these numbers is a matter of unconscious bias. Nobody would affirm the proposition that tall men are intrinsically better leaders, for instance. And yet while only 15 percent of the male population is at least six feet tall, 58 percent of all corporate CEOs are. Similarly, nobody would say that Asian people are unfit to be leaders. But subjects in a recently published psychological experiment consistently rated hypothetical employees with Caucasian-sounding names higher in leadership potential than identical ones with Asian names.

Maybe it is simply the case that a traditionally Asian upbringing is the problem. As Allyn points out, in order to be a leader, you must have followers. Associates at Pricewaterhouse­Coopers are initially judged on how well they do the work they are assigned. “You have to be a doer,” as she puts it. They are expected to distinguish themselves with their diligence, at which point they become “super-doers.” But being a leader requires different skill sets. “The traits that got you to where you are won’t necessarily take you to the next level,” says the diversity consultant Jane Hyun, who wrote a book called Breaking the Bamboo Ceiling. To become a leader requires taking personal initiative and thinking about how an organization can work differently. It also requires networking, self-promotion, and self-assertion. It’s racist to think that any given Asian individual is unlikely to be creative or risk-taking. It’s simple cultural observation to say that a group whose education has historically focused on rote memorization and “pumping the iron of math” is, on aggregate, unlikely to yield many people inclined to challenge authority or break with inherited ways of doing things.

Sach Takayasu had been one of the ­fastest-rising members of her cohort in the marketing department at IBM in New York. But about seven years ago, she felt her progress begin to slow. “I had gotten to the point where I was overdelivering, working really long hours, and where doing more of the same wasn’t getting me anywhere,” she says. It was around this time that she attended a seminar being offered by an organization called Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics.

LEAP has parsed the complicated social dynamics responsible for the dearth of Asian-American leaders and has designed training programs that flatter Asian people even as it teaches them to change their behavior to suit white-American expectations. Asians who enter a LEAP program are constantly assured that they will be able to “keep your values, while acquiring new skills,” along the way to becoming “culturally competent leaders.”

In a presentation to 1,500 Asian-American employees of Microsoft, LEAP president and CEO J. D. Hokoyama laid out his grand synthesis of the Asian predicament in the workplace. “Sometimes people have perceptions about us and our communities which may or may not be true,” Hokoyama told the audience. “But they put those perceptions onto us, and then they do something that can be very devastating: They make decisions about us not based on the truth but based on those perceptions.” Hokoyama argued that it was not sufficient to rail at these unjust perceptions. In the end, Asian people themselves would have to assume responsibility for unmaking them. This was both a practical matter, he argued, and, in its own way, fair.

Aspiring Asian leaders had to become aware of “the relationship between values, behaviors, and perceptions.” He offered the example of Asians who don’t speak up at meetings. “So let’s say I go to meetings with you and I notice you never say anything. And I ask myself, ‘Hmm, I wonder why you’re not saying anything. Maybe it’s because you don’t know what we’re talking about. That would be a good reason for not saying anything. Or maybe it’s because you’re not even interested in the subject matter. Or maybe you think the conversation is beneath you.’ So here I’m thinking, because you never say anything at meetings, that you’re either dumb, you don’t care, or you’re arrogant. When maybe it’s because you were taught when you were growing up that when the boss is talking, what are you supposed to be doing? Listening.”

Takayasu took the weeklong course in 2006. One of the first exercises she encountered involved the group instructor asking for a list of some qualities that they identify with Asians. The students responded: upholding family honor, filial piety, self-­restraint. Then the instructor solicited a list of the qualities the members identify with leadership, and invited the students to notice how little overlap there is between the two lists.

At first, Takayasu didn’t relate to the others in attendance, who were listing typical Asian values their parents had taught them. “They were all saying things like ‘Study hard,’ ‘Become a doctor or lawyer,’ blah, blah, blah. That’s not how my parents were. They would worry if they saw me working too hard.” Takayasu had spent her childhood shuttling between New York and Tokyo. Her father was an executive at Mitsubishi; her mother was a concert pianist. She was highly assimilated into American culture, fluent in English, poised and confident. “But the more we got into it, as we moved away from the obvious things to the deeper, more fundamental values, I began to see that my upbringing had been very Asian after all. My parents would say, ‘Don’t create problems. Don’t trouble other people.’ How Asian is that? It helped to explain why I don’t reach out to other people for help.” It occurred to Takayasu that she was a little bit “heads down” after all. She was willing to take on difficult assignments without seeking credit for herself. She was reluctant to “toot her own horn.”

Takayasu has put her new self-awareness to work at IBM, and she now exhibits a newfound ability for horn tooting. “The things I could write on my résumé as my team’s accomplishments: They’re really impressive,” she says.

The law professor and writer Tim Wu grew up in Canada with a white mother and a Taiwanese father, which allows him an interesting perspective on how whites and Asians perceive each other. After graduating from law school, he took a series of clerkships, and he remembers the subtle ways in which hierarchies were developed among the other young lawyers. “There is this automatic assumption in any legal environment that Asians will have a particular talent for bitter labor,” he says, and then goes on to define the word coolie,a Chinese term for “bitter labor.” “There was this weird self-selection where the Asians would migrate toward the most brutal part of the labor.”

By contrast, the white lawyers he encountered had a knack for portraying themselves as above all that. “White people have this instinct that is really important: to give off the impression that they’re only going to do the really important work. You’re a quarterback. It’s a kind of arrogance that Asians are trained not to have. Someone told me not long after I moved to New York that in order to succeed, you have to understand which rules you’re supposed to break. If you break the wrong rules, you’re finished. And so the easiest thing to do is follow all the rules. But then you consign yourself to a lower status. The real trick is understanding what rules are not meant for you.”

This idea of a kind of rule-governed rule-breaking—where the rule book was unwritten but passed along in an innate cultural sense—is perhaps the best explanation I have heard of how the Bamboo Ceiling functions in practice. LEAP appears to be very good at helping Asian workers who are already culturally competent become more self-aware of how their culture and appearance impose barriers to advancement. But I am not sure that a LEAP course is going to be enough to get Jefferson Mao or Daniel Chu the respect and success they crave. The issue is more fundamental, the social dynamics at work more deeply embedded, and the remedial work required may be at a more basic level of comportment.

What if you missed out on the lessons in masculinity taught in the gyms and locker rooms of America’s high schools? What if life has failed to make you a socially dominant alpha male who runs the American boardroom and prevails in the American bedroom? What if no one ever taught you how to greet white people and make them comfortable? What if, despite these deficiencies, you no longer possess an immigrant’s dutiful forbearance for a secondary position in the American narrative and want to be a player in the scrimmage of American appetite right now, in the present?

How do you undo eighteen years of a Chinese upbringing?

This is the implicit question that J. T. Tran has posed to a roomful of Yale undergraduates at a master’s tea at Silliman College. His answer is typically Asian: practice. Tran is a pickup artist who goes by the handle Asian Playboy. He travels the globe running “boot camps,” mostly for Asian male students, in the art of attraction. Today, he has been invited to Yale by the Asian-American Students Alliance.

“Creepy can be fixed,” Tran explains to the standing-room-only crowd. “Many guys just don’t realize how to project themselves.” These are the people whom Tran spends his days with, a new batch in a new city every week: nice guys, intelligent guys, motivated guys, who never figured out how to be successful with women. Their mothers had kept them at home to study rather than let them date or socialize. Now Tran’s company, ABCs of Attraction, offers a remedial education that consists of three four-hour seminars, followed by a supervised night out “in the field,” in which J. T., his assistant Gareth Jones, and a tall blonde wing-girl named Sarah force them to approach women. Tuition costs $1,450.

“One of the big things I see with Asian students is what I call the Asian poker face—the lack of range when it comes to facial expressions,” Tran says. “How many times has this happened to you?” he asks the crowd. “You’ll be out at a party with your white friends, and they will be like—‘Dude, are you angry?’ ” Laughter fills the room. Part of it is psychological, he explains. He recalls one Korean-American student he was teaching. The student was a very dedicated schoolteacher who cared a lot about his students. But none of this was visible. “Sarah was trying to help him, and she was like, ‘C’mon, smile, smile,’ and he was like …” And here Tran mimes the unbearable tension of a face trying to contort itself into a simulacrum of mirth. “He was so completely unpracticed at smiling that he literally could not do it.” Eventually, though, the student fought through it, “and when he finally got to smiling he was, like, really cool.”

Tran continues to lay out a story of Asian-American male distress that must be relevant to the lives of at least some of those who have packed Master Krauss’s living room. The story he tells is one of Asian-American disadvantage in the sexual marketplace, a disadvantage that he has devoted his life to overturning. Yes, it is about picking up women. Yes, it is about picking up white women. Yes, it is about attracting those women whose hair is the color of the midday sun and eyes are the color of the ocean, and it is about having sex with them. He is not going to apologize for the images of blonde women plastered all over his website. This is what he prefers, what he stands for, and what he is selling: the courage to pursue anyone you want, and the skills to make the person you desire desire you back. White guys do what they want; he is going to do the same.

But it is about much more than this, too. It is about altering the perceptions of Asian men—perceptions that are rooted in the way they behave, which are in turn rooted in the way they were raised—through a course of behavior modification intended to teach them how to be the socially dominant figures that they are not perceived to be. It is a program of, as he puts it to me later, “social change through pickup.”

Tran offers his own story as an exemplary Asian underdog. Short, not good-looking, socially inept, sexually null. “If I got a B, I would be whipped,” he remembers of his childhood. After college, he worked as an aerospace engineer at Boeing and Raytheon, but internal politics disfavored him. Five years into his career, his entire white cohort had been promoted above him. “I knew I needed to learn about social dynamics, because just working hard wasn’t cutting it.”

His efforts at dating were likewise “a miserable failure.” It was then that he turned to “the seduction community,” a group of men on Internet message boards like alt.seduction.fast. It began as a “support group for losers” and later turned into a program of self-improvement. Was charisma something you could teach? Could confidence be reduced to a formula? Was it merely something that you either possessed or did not possess, as a function of the experiences you had been through in life, or did it emerge from specific forms of behavior? The members of the group turned their computer-science and engineering brains to the question. They wrote long accounts of their dates and subjected them to collective scrutiny. They searched for patterns in the raw material and filtered these experiences through social-psychological research. They eventually built a model.

This past Valentine’s Day, during a weekend boot camp in New York City sponsored by ABCs of Attraction, the model is being played out. Tran and Jones are teaching their students how an alpha male stands (shoulders thrown back, neck fully extended, legs planted slightly wider than the shoulders). “This is going to feel very strange to you if you’re used to slouching, but this is actually right,” Jones says. They explain how an alpha male walks (no shuffling; pick your feet up entirely off the ground; a slight sway in the shoulders). They identify the proper distance to stand from “targets” (a slightly bent arm’s length). They explain the importance of “kino escalation.” (You must touch her. You must not be afraid to do this.) They are teaching the importance of sub-­communication: what you convey about yourself before a single word has been spoken. They explain the importance of intonation. They explain what intonation is. “Your voice moves up and down in pitch to convey a variety of different emotions.”

Raj, a 26-year-old Indian virgin, can barely get his voice to alter during intonation exercise. But on Sunday night, on the last evening of the boot camp, I watch him cold-approach a set of women at the Hotel Gansevoort and engage them in conversation for a half-hour. He does not manage to “number close” or “kiss close.” But he had done something that not very many people can do.

Of the dozens of Asian-­Americans I spoke with for this story, many were successful artists and scientists; or good-looking and socially integrated leaders; or tough, brassy, risk-taking, street-smart entrepreneurs. Of course, there are lots of such people around—do I even have to point that out? They are no more morally worthy than any other kind of Asian person. But they have figured out some useful things.

The lesson about the Bamboo Ceiling that James Hong learned from his interviewer at IBM stuck, and after working for a few years at Hewlett-Packard, he decided to strike off on his own. His first attempts at entrepreneurialism failed, but he finally struck pay dirt with a simple, not terribly refined idea that had a strong primal appeal: hotornot.com. Hong and his co-founder eventually sold the site for roughly $20 million.

Hong ran hotornot.com partly as a kind of incubator to seed in his employees the habits that had served him well. “We used to hire engineers from Berkeley—almost all Asian—who were on the cusp of being entrepreneurial but were instead headed toward jobs at big companies,” he says. “We would train them in how to take risk, how to run things themselves. I remember encouraging one employee to read The Game”—the infamous pickup-artist textbook—“because I figured growing the cojones to take risk was applicable to being an entrepreneur.”

If the Bamboo Ceiling is ever going to break, it’s probably going to have less to do with any form of behavior assimilation than with the emergence of risk-­takers whose success obviates the need for Asians to meet someone else’s behavioral standard. People like Steve Chen, who was one of the creators of YouTube, or Kai and Charles Huang, who created Guitar Hero. Or Tony Hsieh, the founder of Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer that he sold to Amazon for about a billion dollars in 2009. Hsieh is a short Asian man who speaks tersely and is devoid of obvious charisma. One cannot imagine him being promoted in an American corporation. And yet he has proved that an awkward Asian guy can be a formidable CEO and the unlikeliest of management gurus.

Hsieh didn’t have to conform to Western standards of comportment because he adopted early on the Western value of risk-taking. Growing up, he would play recordings of himself in the morning practicing the violin, in lieu of actually practicing. He credits the experience he had running a pizza business at Harvard as more important than anything he learned in class. He had an instinctive sense of what the real world would require of him, and he knew that nothing his parents were teaching him would get him there.

You don’t, by the way, have to be a Silicon Valley hotshot to break through the Bamboo Ceiling. You can also be a chef like Eddie Huang, whose little restaurant on the Lower East Side, BaoHaus, sells delicious pork buns. Huang grew up in Orlando with a hard-core Tiger Mom and a disciplinarian father. “As a kid, psychologically, my day was all about not getting my ass kicked,” he says. He gravitated toward the black kids at school, who also knew something about corporal punishment. He was the smallest member of his football team, but his coach named him MVP in the seventh grade. “I was defensive tackle and right guard because I was just mean. I was nasty. I had this mentality where I was like, ‘You’re going to accept me or I’m going to fuck you up.’ ”

Huang had a rough twenties, bumping repeatedly against the Bamboo Ceiling. In college, editors at the Orlando Sentinel invited him to write about sports for the paper. But when he visited the offices, “the editor came in and goes, ‘Oh, no.’ And his exact words: ‘You can’t write with that face.’ ” Later, in film class at Columbia, he wrote a script about an Asian-American hot-dog vendor obsessed with his small penis. “The screenwriting teacher was like, ‘I love this. You have a lot of Woody Allen in you. But do you think you could change it to Jewish characters?’ ” Still later, after graduating from Cardozo School of Law, he took a corporate job, where other associates would frequently say, “You have a lot of opinions for an Asian guy.”

Finally, Huang decided to open a restaurant. Selling food was precisely the fate his parents wanted their son to avoid, and they didn’t talk to him for months after he quit lawyering. But Huang understood instinctively that he couldn’t make it work in the professional world his parents wanted him to join. “I’ve realized that food is one of the only places in America where we are the top dogs,” he says. “Guys like David Chang or me—we can hang. There’s a younger generation that grew up eating Chinese fast food. They respect our food. They may not respect anything else, but they respect our food.”

Rather than strive to make himself acceptable to the world, Huang has chosen to buy his way back in, on his own terms. “What I’ve learned is that America is about money, and if you can make your culture commodifiable, then you’re relevant,” he says. “I don’t believe anybody agrees with what I say or supports what I do because they truly want to love Asian people. They like my fucking pork buns, and I don’t get it twisted.”

Sometime during the hundreds of hours he spent among the mostly untouched English-language novels at the Flushing branch of the public library, Jefferson Mao discovered literature’s special power of transcendence, a freedom of imagination that can send you beyond the world’s hierarchies. He had written to me seeking permission to swerve off the traditional path of professional striving—to devote himself to becoming an artist—but he was unsure of what risks he was willing to take. My answer was highly ambivalent. I recognized in him something of my own youthful ambition. And I knew where that had taken me.

Unlike Mao, I was not a poor, first-­generation immigrant. I finished school alienated both from Asian culture (which, in my hometown, was barely visible) and the manners and mores of my white peers. But like Mao, I wanted to be an individual. I had refused both cultures as an act of self-­assertion. An education spent dutifully acquiring credentials through relentless drilling seemed to me an obscenity. So did adopting the manipulative cheeriness that seemed to secure the popularity of white Americans.

Instead, I set about contriving to live beyond both poles. I wanted what James Baldwin sought as a writer—“a power which outlasts kingdoms.” Anything short of that seemed a humiliating compromise. I would become an aristocrat of the spirit, who prides himself on his incompetence in the middling tasks that are the world’s business. Who does not seek after material gain. Who is his own law.

This, of course, was madness. A child of Asian immigrants born into the suburbs of New Jersey and educated at Rutgers cannot be a law unto himself. The only way to approximate this is to refuse employment, because you will not be bossed around by people beneath you, and shave your expenses to the bone, because you cannot afford more, and move into a decaying Victorian mansion in Jersey City, so that your sense of eccentric distinction can be preserved in the midst of poverty, and cut yourself free of every form of bourgeois discipline, because these are precisely the habits that will keep you chained to the mediocre fate you consider worse than death.

Throughout my twenties, I proudly turned away from one institution of American life after another (for instance, a steady job), though they had already long since turned away from me. Academe seemed another kind of death—but then again, I had a transcript marred by as many F’s as A’s. I had come from a culture that was the middle path incarnate. And yet for some people, there can be no middle path, only transcendence or descent into the abyss.

I was descending into the abyss.

All this was well deserved. No one had any reason to think I was anything or anyone. And yet I felt entitled to demand this recognition. I knew this was wrong and impermissible; therefore I had to double down on it. The world brings low such people. It brought me low. I haven’t had health insurance in ten years. I didn’t earn more than $12,000 for eight consecutive years. I went three years in the prime of my adulthood without touching a woman. I did not produce a masterpiece.

I recall one of the strangest conversations I had in the city. A woman came up to me at a party and said she had been moved by a piece of writing I had published. She confessed that prior to reading it, she had never wanted to talk to me, and had always been sure, on the basis of what she could see from across the room, that I was nobody worth talking to, that I was in fact someone to avoid.

But she had been wrong about this, she told me: It was now plain to her that I was a person with great reserves of feeling and insight. She did not ask my forgiveness for this brutal misjudgment. Instead, what she wanted to know was—why had I kept that person she had glimpsed in my essay so well hidden? She confessed something of her own hidden sorrow: She had never been beautiful and had decided, early on, that it therefore fell to her to “love the world twice as hard.” Why hadn’t I done that?

Here was a drunk white lady speaking what so many others over the years must have been insufficiently drunk to tell me. It was the key to many things that had, and had not, happened. I understood this encounter better after learning about LEAP, and visiting Asian Playboy’s boot camp. If you are a woman who isn’t beautiful, it is a social reality that you will have to work twice as hard to hold anyone’s attention. You can either linger on the unfairness of this or you can get with the program. If you are an Asian person who holds himself proudly aloof, nobody will respect that, or find it intriguing, or wonder if that challenging façade hides someone worth getting to know. They will simply write you off as someone not worth the trouble of talking to.

Having glimpsed just how unacceptable the world judges my demeanor, could I too strive to make up for my shortcomings? Practice a shit-eating grin until it becomes natural? Love the world twice as hard?

I see the appeal of getting with the program. But this is not my choice. Striving to meet others’ expectations may be a necessary cost of assimilation, but I am not going to do it.

Often I think my defiance is just delusional, self-glorifying bullshit that artists have always told themselves to compensate for their poverty and powerlessness. But sometimes I think it’s the only thing that has preserved me intact, and that what has been preserved is not just haughty caprice but in fact the meaning of my life. So this is what I told Mao: In lieu of loving the world twice as hard, I care, in the end, about expressing my obdurate singularity at any cost. I love this hard and unyielding part of myself more than any other reward the world has to offer a newly brightened and ingratiating demeanor, and I will bear any costs associated with it.

The first step toward self-reform is to admit your deficiencies. Though my early adulthood has been a protracted education in them, I do not admit mine. I’m fine. It’s the rest of you who have a problem. Fuck all y’all.

Amy Chua returned to Yale from a long, exhausting book tour in which one television interviewer had led off by noting that Internet commenters were calling her a monster. By that point, she had become practiced at the special kind of self-presentation required of a person under public siege. “I do not think that Chinese parents are superior,” she declared at the annual gathering of the Asian-American Students Alliance. “I think there are many ways to be a good parent.”

Much of her talk to the students, and indeed much of the conversation surrounding the book, was focused on her own parenting decisions. But just as interesting is how her parents parented her. Chua was plainly the product of a brute-force Chinese education. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother includes many lessons she was taught by her parents—lessons any LEAP student would recognize. “Be modest, be humble, be simple,” her mother told her. “Never complain or make excuses,” her father instructed. “If something seems unfair at school, just prove yourself by working twice as hard and being twice as good.”

In the book, Chua portrays her distaste for corporate law, which she practiced before going into academe. “My entire three years at the firm, I always felt like I was playacting, ridiculous in my suit,” she writes. This malaise extended even earlier, to her time as a student. “I didn’t care about the rights of criminals the way others did, and I froze whenever a professor called on me. I also wasn’t naturally skeptical and questioning; I just wanted to write down everything the professor said and memorize it.”

At the AASA gathering at Yale, Chua made the connection between her upbringing and her adult dissatisfaction. “My parents didn’t sit around talking about politics and philosophy at the dinner table,” she told the students. Even after she had escaped from corporate law and made it onto a law faculty, “I was kind of lost. I just didn’t feel the passion.” Eventually, she made a name for herself as the author of popular books about foreign policy and became an award-winning teacher. But it’s plain that she was no better prepared for legal scholarship than she had been for corporate law. “It took me a long, long time,” she said. “And I went through lots and lots of rejection.” She recalled her extended search for an academic post, in which she was “just not able to do a good interview, just not able to present myself well.”

In other words, Battle Hymn provides all the material needed to refute the very cultural polemic for which it was made to stand. Chua’s Chinese education had gotten her through an elite schooling, but it left her unprepared for the real world. She does not hide any of this. She had set out, she explained, to write a memoir that was “defiantly self-incriminating”—and the result was a messy jumble of conflicting impulses, part provocation, part self-critique. Western readers rode roughshod over this paradox and made of Chua a kind of Asian minstrel figure. But more than anything else, Battle Hymn is a very American project—one no traditional Chinese person would think to undertake. “Even if you hate the book,” Chua pointed out, “the one thing it is not is meek.”

“The loudest duck gets shot” is a Chinese proverb. “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down” is a Japanese one. Its Western correlative: “The squeaky wheel gets the grease.” Chua had told her story and been hammered down. Yet here she was, fresh from her hammering, completely unbowed.

There is something salutary in that proud defiance. And though the debate she sparked about Asian-American life has been of questionable value, we will need more people with the same kind of defiance, willing to push themselves into the spotlight and to make some noise, to beat people up, to seduce women, to make mistakes, to become entrepreneurs, to stop doggedly pursuing official paper emblems attesting to their worthiness, to stop thinking those scraps of paper will secure anyone’s happiness, and to dare to be interesting.

I don't mind waiting up for you late hours and I always try to smile when you come in
I don't mind getting up so early get the kids to school and you off to work again
Sometimes a woman's life is not so easy and the man at times is hard to understand
And I can tell sometimes you think you faild me
But in your way I know you do the best you can
So I'll do anything for you anything you want me to
And never once will you hear me complain
For my day is made at night when you kiss and hold me tight
And say you love me cause a woman lives for love
Yes I'll do anything for you...
Yes I'll do anything for you...

"
474,Jean Shepard,28,A Woman's Hand,1970,"

I'm gonna stay right here beside him cause a woman's place is with her man
So many times a man gets lonesome and that's when he needs a helping hand
A woman's hand though soft and gentle can do so much to help her man
Just holding him each time he needs you the power of love is in a woman's band
It's a woman's hand that makes a man go searching
It's a woman's hand that makes a man stay home
For he can't do either one without a woman
It's a woman's hand that leads him right or wrong
For he can't do either one...

Sweetheart I'm all alone tonight
Thinking about my wasted past
I see that you were always right
And now I'm at your feet at last
Take my heart and let it live
This is all I have to give
So please believe me when I say
For all the wrongs I done, I'll pay
--- Instrumental ---
Sweetheart you know I love you
So why did I ever let you go
In dreams you're all that I can see
So won't you reconsider me
My confession to you dear
Makes me shed a silent tear
My heart would be so light sweetheart
If you would say we'll never part...

I've searched for words of sweet description too best described
The thrill it gives me just to have you by my side
But I can't find one single word that properly defines
How sweet it is just knowing that all your love is mine
Your love is heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine
You fill my heart with your sweet love devine
Heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine you make me happy cause your love is mine

The colors in the rainbow are a lovely sight to see
But even rainbows lose their glow when you smile at me
And when you kiss me I can hear a thousand bluebirds sing
No matter how that sounds the words could only mean one thing
Your love is heavenly sunshine...
Heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine...

This great and mighty nation will sing forever more
Of the pioneers brave engineers and heroes by the score
But the world of transportation has its own breed just as great
It's the men of steel behind the wheels of big rigs hauling freight
Listen to the rumble listen to the roar
Of the big wheels on the highways from the mountains to the shore
Ole Buffalo Bill and Casey Jones would never have the gall
The risk their fate on the interstate on the Big Wheel Cannonball
There's lotta speculation when the big wheels roll at night
Some think their destination is a truckstop on the right
With a little ole cat eye waitress or a hot shot on the make
But some I know would rather go for a hot chuck wagon steak
Listen to the rumble listen to the roar
Hear the jingle of the jukebox see the action on the floor
Those giddiup go-go babies do the monkey and the crawl
When a swinging combination plays the Big Wheel Cannonball
[ dobro ]
I try to keep my schedule the way most drivers do
It's food and drinks and forty winks and then go balling through
But tonight I've got a hung up she's the cutest little doll
I'll see you on the straight away on the Big Wheel Cannonball
On the Big Wheel Cannonball on the Big Wheel Cannonball
Tonight she's ridin' shotgun and I warn you one and all
When a devil from St Luis takes an angel on his haul
Don't look for any halo round the Big Wheel Cannonball
Don't look for any halo round the Big Wheel Cannonball

The nights were dark and long I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still my dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing we'd love again the way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you

I could have loved another but I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
Oh I never once stopped believing...

Jesus loves the little children
All the little children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

[Verse 1:]
There is none so blind
That is he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by

You know the world
Gets a little bit older
It's time to realize
That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder

[Chorus:]
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

[Verse 2:]
We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now

Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

[Chorus:]
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way

So if you don't want to love me baby that'll be all right
I'm gonna take all the lovin' that I have for you

I'm gonna give myself a party serve old memories
Give myself a party think of how it used to be
Remember all the happiness we once knew
Gonna give myself a party just me and the blues

Well a few of your love letters a photograph or two
A gift you gave on my birthday with words of I love you
There's a lots of things to think about when you're happy feeling blue

488,Hank Williams Jr.,42,I Walked Out On Heaven,1970,"

[Verse 1]
Well I went on up to Memphis and I walked in the bar
Ordered my whiskey and I says ""I've come far
Up the Mississippi on the Delta Queen
My name is Wham Bam Sam, drumming king from New Orleans.""

[Spoken]
That’s right, and I've been summoned here, by the owner
Now you tell him old Wham Bam Sam has come to his rescue

[Verse 2]
Well, then I had a drink with the leader of the band
And he told me 'bout the problems that they had had
He said ""Sam, our drummer just don’t roll no more
You're gonna see what I mean when the girls come out and do their show.""

[Spoken]
Alright
I see what you mean. I'm gonna fix that problem

[Verse 3]
All the girls come out and dance and then it got mad
'cause the drummer missed a beat just like he always had
They would bump and grind, but he would drag on slow
I got my sticks and I sat down, I said: ""Let me show you how it goes.""
I guess New Orleans is famous for all of its horns
But you've got to have a drum if you want to march along
Hey all you saints looking for Heaven's stairs
You need old Wham Bam Sam, the drumming king to lead you there

[Spoken]
Let's go, boys
And girls too
My name is Wham Bam Sam, the drumming king of New Orleans

[Verse 4]
This song ain't for radio or TV
This song is just for my friends and me
Hey all you saints looking for Heaven’s stairs
You got Wham Bam Sam, the drumming king to lead you there

#4 May '70 Country

I know that cheating river runs by everybody's door
And I might just fall in there anytime
Plus I'm the kind of man that makes decisions on his own
And I'd go with you if I were so inclined

Let me tell you this if I fall in that cheating river
I'm looking for a genuine pearl

You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl

True love never runs but one direction at a time
And right now I'm in love with someone else
But if I should ever lose the love I'm loving at this time
I know I'd never break it up myself

And I won't make any promises so I won't have one to keep
But I've seen some sudden changes in this world
You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl
You'll be the one yes you'll be the one
If I ever fall in love with a honky-tonk girl

If I never love again I won't feel cheated
You gave me more than I knew how to use
When we met I thought loves journey was completed
Oh but now you say our darling days are through

Seems like yesterday we called each other darling
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand
I'd love to hear you say good morning darling
Oh what I'd give to live those darling days again

Today my heart survives on love that's borrowed
From all the happy yesterdays we knew
If I knew for sure the world would end tomorrow
I'd want to spend my last day loving you

Seems like yesterday we called each other darling
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand
I'd love to hear you say good morning darling
Oh what I'd give to live those darling days again

I know you're tired of being all I ever wanted
You'll no longer feel the love I have for you
What happens now what will I do with all the mem'ries
And the dreams of all the things we'll never do
But I won't mention it again I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again I won't mention it again
I feel my life has reached an early sign of autumn
In my heart the leaves are falling love is cold
And everything that once was warm and new is gone now
Leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul
But I won't mention it again...

[Verse 1: Conway Twitty]
There's a devil in my body that I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me even though I love my wife
It's because I really love her I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows, I can see it in her eyes

[Verse 2]
I tried to stay at home, love only her, play with the kids and watch TV
But then my mind becomes unsure about the kind of love I need
My reasons for cheating, they're as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

[Verse 3]
It's so hard for me to call her, I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night, now, I just want to go back home
She knows that I lied, Lord, she'll cry where I can't see
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

[Tag]
How much more can she stand and still stand by me

505,Johnny Cash,9,Man In Black,1971,"

Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been

Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

And I kept rollin' them sevens, winnin' all them pots

My luck was so good, I could do no wrong

I turned around and there was a big old cop

He said ""Hello, boys"", and then he gave us a grin an' said
""Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in
An' keep all that money for evidence""
I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot"", he said, ""Yeah""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
You can 'splain it all down at City Hall
I say, yeah, when you're hot, you're hot
La la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot

Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya, if you'll get me outta this spot""

So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around an' grinned at me an' said
""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot""
An' I said, ""Thanks a lot""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot""

I said, ""Well, I'll tell ya one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on""

""You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who gonna collect my welfare?
Pay for my Cadillac?
Whadda you mean 'Contempt of Court'?
Judge, oh, judge, judgie poo""

"
507,Roger Miller,11,Tomorrow Night In Baltimore,1971,"

Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realise that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease by shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands that cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And she asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage because they open tomorrow night in Baltimore

God' if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in Baltimore

Always remember your whole life through

512,Waylon Jennings,16,Mississippi Woman,1971,"

[Verse 1]
The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
And spattered by the paddle of my eager hand
That Mississippi woman is a waving over yonder
Waving her lantern for her Louisiana man

[Chorus]
How I love that Mississippi woman
How I love that Mississippi girl
How I love that Mississippi woman
But her heart does not belong to me

[Verse 2]
The lantern light and moonbeams are dancing patterns on the water
She doesn't seem to realize I've learned her secret plans
My jealous mind is thinking as I paddle through the sleeping alligators
She don't know I know about her Louisiana man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
And splattered by the paddle of my shaky hand
The silence from behind me is alive with the splashing alligators
And the lantern light is blinking on the bottom in the sand

[Chorus][x2]

"
513,Faron Young,17,Step Aside,1971,"

Angry words were spoken
And I left my baby in a cloud of gloom
Got into my car and drove around
Until I spotted this saloon

Came inside and bought a drink
Then I saw you and felt a burning glow
Got the urge to hold you tight
But if I try refuse me, tell me no

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Bitter is my feelings for my baby
And the things she said so cruel
Half of me says cheat on her
But part of me says stop don't be a fool

Don't let me get close to you
'Cause if I do I won't be very strong
Save me from my conscience
And keep me from being sorry later on

Step aside if I try to get near you
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you
Step aside if I step out of line

Step aside if I step out of line...

Gypsy feet will wander
Gypsy feet will stray
Neither love nor thunder
Can ever make them stay
I can't tame a heart so wild
Like a jungle drum it beats
Were you born a devil's child
With restless gypsy feet

Gypsy feet keep dancin'
To the tune of violins
Just like devil's prancin'
You dance away your sins
If I could tame your restless heart
Would make my life complete
But I can't put an anchor
On those gypsy feet

My picture's in your locket
On that golden chain
Money's in your pocket
And you're gone again
Gypsy lips will promise
Vows they never keep
Hearts like mine are crumbled
Beneath your gypsy feet

Gypsy feet keep dancin'
To the tune of violins
Just like devil's prancin'
You dance away your sins
If I could tame your restless heart
Would make my life complete
But I can't put an anchor
On those gypsy feet

Gypsy feet
Gypsy feet...

Coming for to carry me home
I want you to tell all my friends I'm a coming too

We sure can love each other when we try just like in all the love songs when we try
And some nights I love you so much content to be beside you
And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high
But we sure can hurt each other when we try
We know all the ways to make each other cry
But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by
But we sure can love each other when we try
And I know we'll need each other till we die
And we'll grow old together you and I cause we sure can love each other when we try
Yes we sure can love each other when we try

[Verse:]
This is the song about the time
I nearly starved to death in Roanoke Virginia
I woke up Wednesday morning in my little motel bed
Knowing I would die the minute that I move my head
I felt around to make sure I was in my bed alone
I meet some friendly people when I'm stoned
My payday was on Friday I had two more days to go
Even in my agony I knew that I was broke
Lemme pay the check I said and keep the change my friend
She wiggled out of sight with my last ten
At noon I realized there wasn't any way to eat
For lunch I just went out and shuffled up and down the street
At four o'clock I had a funny feeling in my chest
How long's it take to starve a man to death
I found some pennies in my junk and bought a candy bar
Divided it in pieces and I ate one every hour
I just rolled into town and didn't know a single soul
There wasn't any way to make a loan
Thursday morning I was nearly panicked on the job
I heard my stomach growlin' and my head began to throb
I contemplated murder of the folks that brought their lunch
The sudden smell of food would make me jump
Thursday night they run all food commercials on TV
I slept till nine or ten and then I walked the floor to three
Friday morning I looked for some ketchup on my shirts
My mind was gone my legs began to hurt
The last few minutes up to payin' time were all the worst
The minutes were the years it took to build the universe
Finally it came I got my check and made a dash
Yes I said the man will eat at last
Running down the sidewalk I could see the words so sweet
The sign was flashin' on and on Eat Eat Eat
A half o'pound of ground round ma'm and please don't cook it long
The frizzle of the grill was like a song
I've traveled this world over and I ain't been hungry much
I've been down in my thinking and I've been down on my luck
But the sweetest meal I've ever had in anybody's town
Was a half a pound of plain ground round ground round

528,The Statler Brothers,32,New York City,1971,"

She came to me shortly after Christmas
Said she hated spoiling New Year's Eve
But the truth doesn't wait to come in season
And what we had feared was now believed
She said she'd leave come Monday morning
Catch a plane if I'd split the fare
She had friends who lived in New York City
She'd look them up and have the baby there

And now she's alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
An angel in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now

Honey, will you tell him Bible stories
And give him all the love I never could?
And never tell him too much 'bout his daddy
'Cause there's not too much to say that's good
He'll have to learn it all from his mother:
How to count and say his A-B-C's
But when you teach him prayers to say at bedtime
Leave off ""God bless Daddy,"" won't you please?

And now they're alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
Two angels in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
I can't think about that now

I'll need someone who'll be standing there with me
Someone who can take my smallest dream turn it into the greatest thing

Only a woman like you...

Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times (for the good times)

I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow...

Standing in the silent hall waitin' for the final call
Says he doesn't love me anymore
Shaking hands I pack a bag, trembling voice I call a cab
Slowly I start walking to the door
The cab arrives he blows his horn, I stumble at in the early morn
Tell him of the place I've got to go
Passed a hundred signal lights, paid the bills and a traffic fine
Gettin' through these doors that's been so slow
LA International Airport where the big jet engines roar
LA International Airport I won't see him anymore

The stewardess in a miniskirt, a hippie in a leather shirt
I started on the way to Naples Row
While I'm wondering where it's at, I see a Paris diplomat
Call his kids while trying to get back home
Baggage car goes quickly by, I see my case and start to cry
Stumble to the lounge to be alone
And while I'm trying to get some rest, I bite my lips and try my best
To fight the pain that's making me leave home
LA International Airport...

With silver wings across the sky paper trails and wave goodbye
To those below who've got to stay at home
I wish that I had flown at night so I could take that champagne flight
Rid myself of every tear I own
Soaring high above the heavens in a 747 fighting back the tears that curse my eyes
Captain's voice so loud and clear amplifies into my ear
Assuring me I'm flying friendly skies
LA International Airport...

I see the town
Where we were born
I see the place
We were raised
I see all the things you wanted
That I never gave
I see sadness
I see sorrow
I see pain in your face
But I just can't see
A stranger in my place
I can see now
Where we quarrelled
I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken
When I wasn't strong
I see mem'ries of a love gone bad
That time cannot erase
But I just can't see
A stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do
No one knows the things
That make you cry
Looking back it seems
I never showed you
And now I lay alone
And wonder why
I can see now
Where you might grow tired of dreams
That don't come true
I can see where
I have fallen short
Of the things I promised you
I can see now through
My tear filled eyes no love on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place

Someday these may be all we remember of each other
Please don't tell me how the story ends
Never's just the echo of forever lonesome as the love that might have been
Let me go on loving and believing till it's over please don't tell me how the story ends

543,Roy Clark,47,A Simple Thing As Love,1971,"

When you come across unto me with your hair the tangled grass of evening breezes
And you do not hide your face because somebody said one time it wasn't natural
What a joy for us just running down this crooked trail of midnight
And the peaceful things inside me that it does
Then you whisper low I have to go the acid tears start coming slow
To complicate a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying
Without you I'm a child who sucks the vacant thumb of emptiness
Left crying when he has not had enough
At the mercy of an empty room sing verses to some faded wall
Confused about a simple thing as love

It's too bad we couldn't stay here till the clock runs out and falls from sheer exhaustion
Or till morning when I watch you as you stoop to pick your things up from the floor
But too soon for us it's over and the shock of the electric lightbulb
Sunrise from the ceiling up above
As it dangles to remind us of the spiderweb that binds us
And just complicates a simple thing as love

Awake now I don't hear the floorboards creaking as you walk back from the window
Or feel your satin fingers drawing patterns on my back where I lay dying
Without you I'm a child who sucks the vacant thumb of emptiness
Left crying when he has not had enough
At the mercy of an empty room sing verses to some faded wall
Confused about a simple thing as love

Once you cuff a hoe that shit forever then she stuck with you

All my dogs down for the ride like they Scooby Doo
Turned his housewife into a hoe and a groupie too
Tried to warn a brother but these carrots got her Looney Toons
Sound like I be stirring macaroni it be sticky guu
All I see is white up on the sheets like it was sticky glue
Ass out the bikini when she step in that jacuzzi pool
Just cause we was fucking don't be meaning that I fuck with you

I don't really gotta say a word for a bird to fly
Twitter thugs really have a bird aiming at your eye
In your girl phone she was fucking with another guy
Might be a coincidence that I might be that other guy
Probably was my wife cause we done fucked her then we let her fly
You a mark so I will burn at them Other Guys
Then I turned and ask her, baby girl you know who the shit?
Only one reply and she be screaming out it's Mali Smith

[Verse 3: Matthew Ali]
For my niggas you get hurt, hit you with the MAC

Still riding Uptown like a nigga don't got beef
Niggas they don't want no static, all they bitches I done had em'

Do the dash when i'm whipping

All night long , I tried, but couldn't sleep
Tried to be a man, tried not to weep
Now, I hear the turning of the key
Silently, the guard motions to me

Now, I realize the end is near
And I find I can't control my fear
As I pass the guard, I start to cry
And I whisper, "" I don't want to die""

Then, from Death Row comes a whisper
""Charlie, be a man""
Then, I scream, ""Just wait 'til your turn
Then, see if you can""

Down the hall, they push and carry me
Blind with fright and tears won't let me see
Through a door and then, I stop and stare
'Cause I see it, there it is, the chair

Then, they strap me in and turn to leave
And the Prison Chaplain says, ""Believe
Faith in God will cause Him to forgive""
I have faith, but still, I wanna live

Suddenly, I'm paralized
This must be the end
My body jerks and trembles
And they turn it on again

As quickly as it came, the pain is gone
I hear music. Someone sings a song
Suddenly, I seem to float through air
Something's wrong, 'cause I'm still in the chair

In the room, there's hardly any light
And I see the Doctor dressed in white
I hear every word that's plainly said
Did I hear him say, ""This man is dead""

It's over, our love affair
Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
She's gone, I'm alone
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date

I searched for a simply way
To tell her what I had to say
I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date

Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize

So blind I couldn't see
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be
On my mind, in my heart
I was blind from the start
Lost her love on our last date...

Ringin' your hands thinkin' no man understands

To me there's nothin' sadder than to see a lonely woman
Neglected by the one she loves so much
Chances are she works all day and then goes home tonight
And sits all night just longin' for his touch

Yet I've known girls with husbands in the house
And still they're lonely
They've lost him to the TV and the beer
I guess somehow my heart goes out to all the lonely women
In love with all the men who just don't care

553,Glen Campbell,7,Manhattan Kansas,1972,"

Manhattan, Kansas ain't no place to have a baby
When you got no man to give it his last name
And her folks back in Manhattan didn't want her or her bundle
So she took her child and caught an evenin' train

She found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner
At least it buys her baby milk to drink
He once told her she was pretty but the only ring it got her
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played
But at least she didn't beg him
She'd rather wash her dishes
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean

At night she stands there thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how her folks just turned away the shame
She stares down through the soap suds
Reaches down and pulls the drain plug
And watches as Manhattan drains away

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played
But at least she didn't beg him
She'd rather wash her dishes
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean

Yes it makes her feel as if her hands are clean

"
555,Buck Owens,9,Made In Japan,1972,"

My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan

The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan

In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan

My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan

[Verse 1]
I guess you noticed there is only eleven roses
I chose them from our garden where they grew
Take the roses and look into the mirror
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you

[Chorus]
There's just something about a spray of roses
To a woman they say more than man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyway

There's just something about a spray of roses
To a woman they say more than man can say
After what I've done you may not keep the roses
But I just thought I would send them anyway

559,The Statler Brothers,13,Do You Remember These,1972,"

Saturday morning serials chapters 1 through 15
Fly paper, penny loafers, Lucky Strike Green
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, Pepsi please
Ah, do you remember these?

Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Styx nose plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?

The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?

James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?

The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?

To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?

Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows
Ah, do you remember those?

Gable's charm, Frog in your arm, loud mufflers, pitchin' woo
Going steady, Veronica and Betty, white bucks, and Blue Suede Shoes
Knock Knock jokes: Who's there? Dewey. Dewey who?
Do we remember these? Yes we do. Ah, do we, do we remember these

560,Connie Smith,14,Just For What I Am,1972,"

Blue ain't just a word
It's a feeling
A feeling of loneliness
That I can feel right now
Love has looked at me
But tried to change me
I wished that love would take me just for what I am

Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me
To feel like that old memory
Just for what they see just for being me
I want someone to love me just for what I am

Cry ain't just a sound
It's a sadness
A sadness that lives with me
And follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wished that love would take me just for what I am

Just for what I am...
I want someone to love me just for what I am

So overcome by anyone like this

Now I am lost forever in your kiss

So take me if you want me
Love me if you will
For you have all control of me
And I am yours until
'Til you say that you don't want me
Oh I hope that never will be
For I am lost forever in your kiss

[Verse 2]
You're on my mind constantly, oh and this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you and I'll do anything you want me to
For I am lost forever in your kiss

[Chorus]

And I am yours until

There are times when I should be strong
When I'm awfully weak

Needs someone to understand
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so

Some folks call me a laughin' boy some say I'm a clown
But till you've tried my way of life don't ever put it down
And if it feels good do it if it hurts just let it lie
Now there's no mistery to it just a better way to look at life

Some folks worry bout growin' old but that don't bother me
Old age is one thing I hope that I live long enough to see
Forget your disappointments pretend they wasn't there
But when they pass out happiness be sure you get your share
And if it feels good...

One day when I'm old and gray lookin' back at what I've done
I can face the world and say that livin' sure was fun
And if it feels good...
And if it feels good...

Smell the flowers

Got a troubled mind, friend
Did you let too much worry rule your days?
When you look back
Do you feel like something precious slipped away?

Oh, my friend are you the man
That the world slip through your hands?
Can you remember

Smell the flowers while the roses bloom

Gonna look on the lonely days a little bit brighter
My heart's been throwed around it ain't done enough laughin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good to worry none
Just turns your hair gray while you're still young
Love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen

Could be miles away or right beside you

Like you've had so many time and how
Loving you could never be better than it is right now
Tomorrow night we'll meet again
To once more fan the flame
'Cause loving you the way I do stays the same
This love of ours is just as strong
As any vow could be
And love could never be better for you and me

Promised her he'd take her for his bride

What`s your mama`s name, child?
What`s your mama`s name?

[Verse 1:]
Thirty some odd years ago
A young man came to Memphis
Asking about a rose
That used to blossom in his world

People never took the time
To mind the young man`s questions
Until one day
They heard him ask a little green eyed girl

[Chorus:]
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?

Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?
What`s your mama`s name, child?
What`s your mama`s name?

[Verse 2:]
Twenty some odd years ago
A drunk down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail

Just because he asked
A little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel`s worth of candy
If she`d tell

A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul the county had to claim

Inside the old man`s ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green

[Chorus:]
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?

What`s your mama's name?
What`s your mama's name, child?

My legs are shaky as I walk across the floor
And my voice trembles as I call out ""I'm home""
Do my eyes deceive me or is my baby gone

Baby's gone, she couldn't stand to tell me face to face
And things just ain't the way they used to be around this place
Her perfume lingers where she once lay her head
And I can almost taste the teardrops baby shed
As she searched her mind and tried to find
Just where it all went wrong
But it's ended and it's over
Baby's gone

[Chorus]
Baby's gone, she couldn't stand to tell me face to face
And things just ain't the way they used to be around this place
Her perfume lingers where she once lay her head
And I can almost taste the teardrops baby shed
As she searched her mind and tried to find
Just where it all went wrong
Lord it's ended and it's over
Baby's gone

"
600,Charlie Rich,4,Behind Closed Doors,1973,"

My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd

'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say ""I want you""

She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me

'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

601,Johnny Rodriguez,5,You Always Come Back (To Hurting Me),1973,"

[Verse 1]
I'm beginning to believe I get my kicks from being hurt
Instead of making love feel better, you just make it worse
You tell me go, then call me back, and then you set me free
You always come back to hurtin' me

[Chorus]
You always come back to hurtin' me
As sweet and stinging as a honey bee
I'm never really sorry when you leave
You always come back to hurting me

[Verse 2]
Wanting you, I know I'm throwing good love after bad
But I'll admit the worst of you is still the best I've had
I'm that way, you're that way, and it's maybe meant to be
You always come back to hurting me
You always come back to hurtin' me

602,Tammy Wynette,6,Kids Say The Darndest Things,1973,"

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 1]
Last night, dressed up in high-heel shoes
And wearing my old hat
My four-year-old said, ""I want a divorce""
Now where did she hear that?

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 2]
Last night, as I watched TV
One rushed through the door
""Mommy, Daddy's telling someone on the phone
'Don't you call me here no more'""

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 3]
Bet my daddy can whip your daddy
But Daddy's never home
And I think Mommy's worried 'bout him
'Cause she cried all night long

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?

[Verse 4]
You never know what they learn at school
Or what they're thinking of
My first grader just said a four-letter word
And it sure wasn't love

[Chorus]
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play
Or the little songs they sing?
Kids say the darndest things

603,Merle Haggard,7,The Emptiest Arms In The World,1973,"

[Verse 1]
I only call when I've had that one too many
And my lonely room goes spinning in a whirl
And tonight I couldn't even find my pillow

[Chorus]
I've got the emptiest arms in the world

[Verse 2]
I no longer wear the gold band on my finger
And from time to time I find myself a girl
But when I realize that she's not who I'm holding

[Chorus]
I've got the emptiest arms in the world

[Verse 3]
Empty arms won't ever hold you close again
And these cheap hotels they're like a prison cell that keeps closing in

[Chorus][x2]
And you alone can fill this empty feeling
Of the emptiest arms in the world

Why you do these things to me
Sometime I worry, girl
That you ain't in love with me

Sometime I stay out late
Yeah, I'm having fun
Yes, I guess you know by now
You ain't the only one

Baby, sweet things
That you promised me, babe
Seemed to go up in smoke
Yeah, vanish like a dream

I wonder why you do
These things to me
'Cause I'm worried, I just
Can't seem to find my way, baby

Ooh, the nights I spent
Just waiting on the sun
Just like your
Burned out cigarette

You threw away my love
Why did you do that, baby?
I wonder why, why you do
These things to me

I'm worried, Lord
I'll find out anyway
Sure going to find
Myself a girl someday
Till then I'm worried

Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way
Yeah, I'm a hard working man
When did I ever do you wrong?
Yeah, I get all my money, baby

Bring it, bring it all home
Yeah, I'm telling the truth
Sweet things, sweet things
That you promised me

Well I'm worried, I just
Can't seem to find my way, baby
I'm worried about you
I'm worried about you

Tell you something now
Worried 'bout you, child
Worried 'bout you, woman

Yeah, I'm worried
Lord, I'll find out anyway
Sure as hell, I'm going
To find that girl someday

Till then I'm worried
Lord, I just can't seem
To find my way

What's that around your head, is it a halo?
And what's that on your shoulders, is it wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Around you is a light that keeps on glowin'
When you speak do I hear angels sing?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

When we met you gave me strength to face the world
I believe you're special, you're no ordinary girl

Am I seein' light or am I dreaming?
Do I hear the rush of angels wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Or is it love that makes me see these things

To shield your head
And with these hands

Come live with me and be my love

610,Buck Owens,14,Ain't It Amazing  Gracie,1973,"

I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you
Well I left my Gracie and I cought a big train searching for wealth and fame
But every clickety-clack of the railroad track seemed to bring out my Gracie's name
Well ain't it amazing Gracie how much that I love you
I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you

Well she's not the prettiest girl in the world I know she's not the smartest one too
But she's always there and I know she cares and I know her little heart is true
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...

I met a lot of pretty girls wherever I'd go none could ever take her place
Cause everytime I'd look into their eyes I keep a seein' my Gracie's face
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...

[Intro]
What my woman can't do can't be done

[Verse 1]
It amazes me how she can change my mind
When it seems to be impossible, she can do it every time
And the way she always loves me, she's got that down perfect too
I keep asking myself, ""What is it the lady can't do?""

[Verse 2]
She brightens any room she walks inside
And the way she comes in smiling, you'd never think she ever cried
She still looks as young and pretty as the day we met
If there's one thing bad about her, I ain't found it yet

[Chorus]
What it is my woman can't do, can't be done
If there's ever been a darlin', I've got one
She beats all I've ever seen
She's the champion of our team
What my woman can't do can't be done
What my woman can't do can't be done

613,Tommy Overstreet,17,Send Me No Roses,1973,"

I would send her a rose
When I couldn't make it home
I was always away she was always alone

But roses couldn't hold her tight
Or keep her warm in the night
And in time she slipped away
I can still hear her say

Send me no roses
Send no roses today
Just like our dreams
The fragrance will soon fade away

The magic is gone
Our love has died on the vine
Send no roses
Roses can't bring it back this time

Empty arms reaching out
Left so unsatisfied
Needing so much to find
The love she was denied

What she wanted was my love
Roses weren't quite enough
I remember the day that I heard baby say

Send me no roses
Send no roses today
Just like our dreams
The fragrance will soon fade away

The magic is gone
Our love has died on the vine
Send no roses
Roses can't bring it back this time

Send me no roses
Send no roses today
Just like our dreams
The fragrance will soon fade away

The magic is gone
Our love has died on the vine
Send no roses
Roses can't bring it back this time

Why me Lord?
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you
Or the kindness you've shown?

Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus

Try me, Lord
If you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord
I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you

Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus

616,Susan Raye,20,Cheating Game,1973,"

Break a heart and laugh and walk away of true love you've made a mockery
Free to go knowing next time you'll pay for your common vice the cheating game
Love and lies go hand in hand your love goes free like wind blow sand
Seeking out unwary prey teaching them the way you play the cheating game
Who knows the mind of the cheating kind who's blocked the shadows from sight
Who's gonna pay the price to make the wrong seem right
You're gonna go act free to live a life without a blame
While I reap the harvest of heartaches from the cheating game

You planted the seed now I must sow my love alone to make it grow
Carrying the only thing you left me a legacy from the cheating game
The web of dreams you weave so well was casting to die for my private hell
Taking love forsaking love making me a viction of the cheating game
Who knows the mind of the cheating kind...

Ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

This old highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides they is scarce as the rain
When you're down to your last, shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train

Been a good month of Sunday's and a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

I've put snow on the mountain, raised hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum, a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

Yeah, won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come

You say, you're gonna leave me, pack up and go
You don't wanna hurt me, but you've just gotta have him
And how will I take it you want to know

Well, if you can live with it, I can live without it
If you can face your conscience, I can face my pride
If you can live with it, I can live without it
'Cause I did the only thing I could do, baby, I tried

Can you really take your rings off without feeling kinda dirty?
Can you really kiss him while you're wearing my name?
Can you run your fingers all across his body
Without missin' me a little and feeling ashamed?

If you can live with it, I can live without it
If you can face your conscience, I can face my pride
If you can live with it, I can live without it
'Cause I did the only thing I could do, baby, I tried

Ravishing Ruby, she'd been around for awhile
Ravishing Ruby, she was a truck stop child
Born in the back of a rig somewhere near L.A
Ravishing Ruby, you poured a lot of hot coffee in your day
Ravishing Ruby, believe anything you say
Just like her daddy said, he said he'd be back someday
She was just fourteen, she grew up wild and free
And all the time she'd be waitin' on him
She'd been waiting on you and me

[Chorus:]
Ravishing Ruby, she sleeps in a bunk out back
Her days and nights were filled
With dreams of a man named Smilin' Jack
That was her daddy's name and that's all she ever knew
Ravishing Ruby ain't got time for guys like me and you

[Verse 2:]
Ravishing Ruby, a beautiful young girl now
Ravishing Ruby, she made a solemn vow
Waitin' on Smilin' Jack, he'll come rollin' by
And she wants to see him
She wants to touch him either way, dead or alive

You've got to give a little take a little if you want to get a little lovin'
And do all the things that make your man feel right
And if you give a little take a little then you're gonna get a lotta lovin'
And you're never gonna ever have to spend another lonely night

If he needs a little lovin' then hold him
Cause if you don't the fires of love are gonna get a little cold and dim
And if his day don't go your way then take it with a little smile
After all it's the ups and downs of love that makes it all worthwhile
You've got to give a little...

Never mind the times when his feet feel the need for freedom
Just as long as they bring him on home to you when you need him
To show you care you gotta be there when he laughs or when he cries
There's no mistaking givin' and talking is the very best part of life
You've got to give a little...
You've got to give a little...

Well now love is believing so don't fight the feelings don't fight the feelings of love

A boy and a girl in a big spinning world upside down in love from the start
Sunny days and laughing skies true love in both their eyes
Spending happy good times in the park
Learning all about living taking and the giving love is growing stronger every day
Well now there'll never be another cause they're trusting each other
Good love seems to just work out that way
I said now don'tcha...
Don't fight the feelings don't fight the feelings don't fight the feelings of love

Well it's over, and nobody wins
Well it really doesn't matter
Who's right or wrong?
We've been hustling each other for much too long
And it's too late to try to say, what might have been
It's over, and nobody wins
Make believe and forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder, each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistakes again and again
Oh it's over, and nobody wins

We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The love it was easy, it's the living that's hard
For there's no need to say to see the way it is
Oh, it's over and nobody wins

629,Jim Ed Brown,33,Southern Loving,1973,"

I've been loved in Cincinnati, Evansville and in St. Paul
All the gals were pretty and I ain't tryin' to find no fault
There's a gal in the Windy City I can't forget about
But if you want to love like you ain't had love go south, south, south
Southern loving, take that southern loving every time

There's a sweet thing in Augusta got the softest lips of all
When she kisses on you you just climb right up the wall
And there's a nurse I know in Memphis got love for a middle name
If she ever gets her hands on you it's shame, shame, shame
Southern loving, take that southern loving every time

Now everybody's heard about that southern hospitality
But that ain't why the sunny south has got a hold on me

There's a teacher down in Dallas I ain't seen in quite some time
Just to think about her burns a hole right through my mind
And there's a gal in Bogalusa just can't love enough
I'll tell you about her with just three words she's tough, tough, tough
Southern loving, take that southern loving every time

Now everybody's heard about that southern hospitality
But that ain't why the sunny south has got it's hold on me

Southern loving, take that southern loving every time
It's southern loving, take that southern loving every time...

[Verse]
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)

And the reason he wrote er this song
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
They would walk down the street in the evenin
And for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam of their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy
And I loved to go taggin along
Wed hold hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing er his song
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
Now he walks down the street in the evenin
And he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe hes believin
Hes holdin er hand like before
For he feels all her love walkin with him
And he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop
And gives her a daisy a day
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away

I've seen him as he awakens in the morning
He reaches out his hand and without a word
As his fingers softly fall upon my face
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him

And love is the foundation we lean on
All you need is love to ease your mind
And does it have to be right to be called love
When he gives me more loving
Than a lifetime of looking could ever find

When he thinks there's something better than at home
But a woman's intuition will spoil the competition
She can stop the crop before the seeds are sown

When I need strength
You're there to give it, baby
You're always standing by
When I need warmth
Your arms surround my soul
Till the flames of love are burning high

You know my needs are many
And you're there to pull me through
And when I'm really needing loving
Darling, you give me you

You seem to know the moments
That I feel most all alone
Your light can chase the
Darkness from my mind

With you laying here beside me
How could I want to leave?
What better kind of loving could I find?

When I need strength
You're there to give it, baby
You're always standing by

Your arms surround my soul
Till the flames of love are burning high

You know my needs are many

640,Vicki Lawrence,45,The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia,1973,"

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop at Webb's
And have him a drink before he went home to her

Andy Wolloe said hello
And he said, ""Hi, what's doing, Wo?""
Said, ""Sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt.""

He said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth.""

Well, he got mad and he saw red
And Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home, cause he didn't live far
See, Andy didn't have many friends
And he just lost him one

Brother thought his wife musta left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Papa had left him and that was a gun

Then he went off to Andy's house
Slippin' through the backwoods, quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Well, the Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
And a big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun
And said ""Why'd you do it?""

Well, the judge said guilty in a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, ""Supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
And that's one body that'll never be found
See, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia, whoa-oh
That's the night that they hung an innocent man, uh-huh
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia

[Verse 1]
Well I’m just a post, of which you lean
Never your love, just a go between
Change of a heart, that can’t be free
The image of a man I thought I’d be

[Chorus]
Alone so low with misery
Nothing but blues for company
Well if things get worse, I can’t shake this curse
Then start draggin' the river for me

[Verse 2]
Well the flame of love, once won my soul
Now it’s a spot, so dark and cold
Tears that I’ve cried, won’t flow no more
'Cause my heart just died at heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Alone so low with misery
Nothing but blues for company
Well if things get worse, I can’t shake this curse
Then start draggin' the river for me

Then start draggin' the river for me

644,Mac Davis,49,Your Side Of The Bed,1973,"

Lord, I miss you
I just can't get it
Through my weary head
You're really gone

I just can't believe it
But all of a sudden
I've got too much pain
For one man alone

The nights drag by
And it gets harder all the time
To go to sleep without
Your soft skin touching mine

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Ringing half past eight
With that old familiar hunger
And my arms wrapped
Round your shadow
I woke up on your side of the bed

Another funky morning
Sunday's dead and Monday's
Dripping down my window pane

I wake up shaking
Staring at the walls and
Listening to the lonesome
Sound of falling rain

I just can't make myself
Believe that you don't care
I keep on dreaming
I'll wake up and you'll be there

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Lord, I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock
Ringing half past eight...

Here he comes now
I've got to tell him somehow
I could put it off till later
But it's best I do it now

Baby, listen to me
There is something I must try to say
I've put it off so long
But I've decided that today is the day

My love for you is dying
Oh, no, please don't start crying

"
647,Melba Montgomery,1,No Charge,1974,"

My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love is no charge

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love, is - charge

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge

650,Roy Clark,4,Honeymoon Feelin',1974,"

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

It seems like only yesterday you walked into my life
And answered all my prayers and made my dreams come true
And even though it's been some time since I made you my wife
Every day I find I'm even more in love with you

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I'm thankful that I wake up with an angel by my side
You make my world a better place to be
And though were far from newlyweds you're still my brushing bride
But most of all I'm glad you show just how much you need me

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again

I still get that honeymoon feeling
After all these years my heart goes reeling
Every time you touch me it's the living end
I still get that honeymoon feeling
I can still hear those wedding bells ringing
Every time we love I get that honeymoon feeling again...

653,Olivia Newton-John,7,If You Love Me (let Me Know),1974,"

You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says ""hello, it's good to see you""
Anytime I turn around to find you there

It's this and so much more that make me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Loving you

654,Dottie West,8,Last Time I Saw Him,1974,"

Last time I saw him, he sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him, he said, ""I'll be back for more of this""
Last time I saw him, we were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving but he had to set us up

I gave him money, I know I invested well
Mama doesn't trust him but he loves me, I can tell
Each day the Greyhound arrives at nine o'clock
But I don't start my crying 'til that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was Greyhound bound
But I'm still waiting here without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I've had no letter, it's been six months maybe better
I tried forgettin' him, but I love him more than ever
I have decided I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong he would return right on that bus
There must be trouble so I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye, he said, ""Don't cry
I'm coming back come rain or shine""

Last time I saw him, last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him, he was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye, he said, ""Don't cry
I'm coming back come rain or shine""

Well, we're country singers
We got golden fingers and
We're loved everywhere we go

We do our picking
And we do our grinning
For ten thousand dollars a show

We get all kinds of thrills
From all kinds of deals
But the one we never knew

Is the one that'll getcha
When you get your picture
On the cover of the Music City News

(CHORUS)
(Music City News)
Wanna see my picture on the cover
(News) gonna buy five copies
For my mother (news)
Gonna see my smiling face
On the cover of the Music City News

Got a big long bus
With a driver named Gus
That shines our cowboy boots
(That's right)

Got a custom made car
With a built in bar
And a closet full of Nudie suits

We fly jet airplanes
And drink pink champagne
With folks like Howard Hughes

And we keep getting richer
But we can't get out picture
On the cover of the Music City News

(repeat CHORUS)
We got snuff queen babys
And some backstage ladies
With furs and diamond rings

We got aunts and uncles
And shirt tail cousins like
You ain't never seen

We got all the friends
That money can buy
So we never have to sing the blues

And they all call us mister
But we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Music City News

656,Cal Smith,10,Country Bumpkin,1974,"

He walked up to the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool
And with a long soft southern drawl said
I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool;
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down
And she thought I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town

She said. ""Hello country bumpkin, how's the frost down on the pumpkin?
I've seen some sights, but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin?""

It was just a short year later in a bed
Of joy-filled tears, yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders
One more wonder came;
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marvelled at the soft and warm
And cuddly boy child feeding at her breast

And she said,""Hello country bumpkin
Fresh as frost down on the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights, but babe you're somethin'
Mama loves her country bumpkin""

Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet
And peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face;
She was lying on her death-bed knowing fully well
Her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into
The sad eyes of her husband and her son

And she said,""So long country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later country bumpkin

If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay

And just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could pray each night to thank the Lord that all is right
We could we could you and I

And stare ---- at your T V

You'd have a room full of roses

I would tear them all apart
I'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you broke my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send a roses, maybe too
Don't send me a room full of roses
But I want my arms around you

And if I took the petals
I would tear them all apart

And those forbidden places aren't forbidden anymore
If my back door could talk, it would tell me
That my borrowed angel's been this far before

I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, ""Darling, let's go all the way""
And I just found out my woman is the devil
I just started hatin' cheatin' songs today

Did she sleep in your arms last night, mister?
Were you the one who gladly helped her make it through the night?
Did she whisper, ""it's not love but it's not bad?""
Did she forget to wake you up to say goodbye?

I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, ""Darling, let's go all the way""
And I just found out my woman is the devil
I just started hatin' cheatin' songs today

With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning

Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning

And Flight 50 cuts a path
Across the morning sky

Coffee, tea or something stronger
To start off the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning

Just because I ask a friend about him

He thinks I still care

And if he's happy thinking I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
But how could he ever be so foolish?
Or where would he get such an idea?

Just because I ask a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I saw him, then went all to pieces
He thinks I still care

675,Ray Price,29,Storms Of Troubled Times,1974,"

Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach...

"
676,Loretta Lynn,30,They Don't Make 'Em Like My Daddy,1974,"

I wasn't much more than a baby, I thought he was a bear
The way my daddy carried me around
They said, I learned to walk while holdin' on to just one finger
On the hand of a man that stands at six-foot-three

Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression
Just something people talked about a lot
My daddy wasn't one that tried to make no big impressions
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he got

They don't make men like my daddy anymore
Guess they've thrown away the pattern through the years
In a great big land of freedom, at a time we really need 'em
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

From the Johnson County Coal Camps to the hills of West Virginia
My daddy worked on timber dark coal mines
Education didn't count so much as what you had born in you
Like the will to live and a dream of better times

Daddy never took a handout, we ate pinto beans a bacon
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the door
And it only proves one thing to me when folks start belly achin'
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

They don't make men like my daddy anymore
Guess they've thrown away the pattern through the years
In a great big land of freedom at a time we really need 'em
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

I can't take your hurt and wish it away or condemn a love you knew yesterday
I can't be the past you want to relive my part of forever is all I can give
I can't be a part of some other time
Or free the memories that's chained to your heart
I can't take his dreams and make them live my part of forever is all I can give
All I can give is the love you see it's all that I have that belongs to me
I was not the cause of yesterday's rain
I never said the words that brought on the pain
The life you had with him is not mine to live my part of forever is all I can give
My part of forever is all I can give

Since your sweet love has died

Seems we've lost the way to find
All the good times we found before
Yeah, we used to laugh a lot
Things aren't funny anymore

[Verse 2]
If I knew how to change your mind
Maybe things could be right again
If I could turn back one page of time
Before love came to an end

[Chorus 2]
I'd know just where to turn
To turn it all on once more
Maybe we laughed too soon
Things aren't funny anymore

To turn it all on once more
Maybe we laughed too soon

687,Johnny Cash,41,Ragged Old Flag,1974,"

[Verse]
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said ""Your old court house is kind of run down""
He said ""Naw, it'll do for our little town""
I said ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit""
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said ""Have a seat"", and I sat down
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town?""
I said ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Because she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more""

[Outro]
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag

She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses....

Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone

She'd go another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She's got a bent, bony body and stringy hair

If she ever seen why'all messing round there
She'd go another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp come handsome Jack

A no good man like you all know
He was looking around for Marie Laveau
He said Marie Laveau, you handsome witch
Give me a little a little charm that'll make me rich

Give me a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night, I'm gonna marry you
Then It'll be another man done gone
So Marie done some magic, and she shook a little sand

Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie

You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing
And she went another man done gone

So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man, you better stay with her for the rest of your life

Or it'll be another man done gone

The distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain unto the night

How many times I have wondered
But it always comes out the same
No matter how I look at or think about it
It's just like some of it's pleasures some of it's pain

I find me a place in a boxcar so I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest, I hold your picture to my chest and then I'm all right
But it's still a rainy night in Georgia, it's a rainy night in Georgia
I believe it must be rainin' all over this world

All over the world

Well, life on a farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack

A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
When the work's all done and the sun's setting low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play ""Sally Goodin'"" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools

Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, ""Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride

My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

From the window up above

You must have thought that I was sleeping
Oh, I wish that I had been
But it's best I get to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I was watching
From the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
Well, I hope he makes you happy
And you never lose his love

Chapter 1

Meet Joe Spud

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a million pounds?

    Or a billion?

    How about a trillion?

    Or even a gazillion?

    Meet Joe Spud.

    Joe didn’t have to imagine what it would be like to have loads and loads and loads of money. He was only twelve, but he was ridiculously, preposterously rich.

    Joe had everything he could ever want.

100-inch plasma widescreen flat-screen high-definition TV in every room in the house ✓
500 pairs of Nike trainers ✓
A grand-prix racetrack in the back garden✓
A robot dog from Japan ✓
A golf buggy with the number plate ‘SPUD 2’ to drive around the grounds of his house ✓
A waterslide which went from his bedroom into an indoor Olympic-sized swimming pool ✓
 Every computer game in the world ✓
3-D IMAX cinema in the basement ✓
A crocodile ✓
24-hour personal masseuse ✓
Underground 10-lane bowling alley ✓
Snooker table ✓
Popcorn dispenser ✓
Skateboard park ✓
Another crocodile ✓
£100,000 a week pocket money ✓
A rollercoaster in the back garden ✓
A professional recording studio in the attic ✓
Personalised football coaching from the England team ✓
A real-life shark in a tank ✓
In short, Joe was one horribly spoilt kid. He went to a ridiculously posh school. He flew on private planes whenever he went on holiday. Once, he even had Disneyworld closed for the day, just so he wouldn’t have to queue for any rides.

    Here’s Joe. Speeding around his own private racetrack in his own Formula One racing car.

    Some very rich children have miniature versions of cars specially built for them. Joe wasn’t one of those children. Joe needed his Formula One car made a bit bigger. He was quite fat, you see. Well, you would be, wouldn’t you? If you could buy all the chocolate in the world.

    You will have noticed that Joe is on his own in that picture. To tell the truth, speeding around a racetrack isn’t that much fun when you are on your own, even if you do have a squillion pounds. You really need someone to race against. The problem was Joe didn’t have any friends. Not one.
Friends xNow, driving a Formula One car and unwrapping a king-size Mars Bar are two things you shouldn’t try and do at the same time. But it had been a few moments since Joe had last eaten and he was hungry. As he entered the chicane, he tore open the wrapper with his teeth and took a bite of the delicious chocolate-coated nougat and caramel. Unfortunately, Joe only had one hand on the steering wheel, and as the wheels of the car hit the verge, he lost control.

    The multi-million-pound Formula One car careered off the track, span around, and hit a tree.

SSSSSSSSSCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCRRRRRRRRR
RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEECC
CCCCCCCCCCHHHHH
HHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The tree was unharmed. But the car was a write-off. Joe squeezed himself out of the cockpit. Luckily Joe wasn’t hurt, but he was a little dazed, and he tottered back to the house.

    “Dad, I crashed the car,” said Joe as he entered the palatial living room.

    Mr Spud was short and fat, just like his son. Hairier in a lot of places too, apart from his head – which was bald and shiny. Joe’s dad was sitting on a hundred-seater crocodile skin sofa and didn’t look up from reading that day’s copy of the Sun.

    “Don’t worry Joe,” he said. “I’ll buy you another one.”

    Joe slumped down on the sofa next to his dad.

    “Oh, happy birthday, by the way, Joe.” Mr Spud handed an envelope to his son, without taking his eyes off the girl on Page 3.

    Joe opened the envelope eagerly. How much money was he going to receive this year? The card, which read ‘Happy 12th Birthday Son’, was quickly discarded in favour of the cheque inside.

    Joe could barely disguise his disappointment. “One million pounds?” he scoffed. “Is that all?”

    “What’s the matter, son?” Mr Spud put down his newspaper for a moment.

    “You gave me a million last year,” whined Joe. “When I turned eleven. Surely I should get more now I’m twelve?”

    Mr Spud reached into the pocket of his shiny grey designer suit and pulled out his chequebook. His suit was horrible, and horribly expensive.

    “I’m so sorry son,” he said. “Let’s make it two million.”

    Now, it’s important you realise that Mr Spud had not always been this rich.

    Not so long ago the Spud family had lived a very humble life. From the age of sixteen, Mr Spud worked in a vast loo-roll factory on the outskirts of town. Mr Spud’s job at the factory was sooooo boring. He had to roll the paper around the cardboard inner tube.

    Roll after roll.

    Day after day.

    Year after year.

    Decade after decade.

    This he did, over and over again, until nearly all his hope had gone. He would stand all day by the conveyor belt with hundreds of other bored workers, repeating the same mind-numbing task. Every time the paper was rolled onto one cardboard tube, the whole thing started again. And every loo roll was the same. Because the family was so poor, Mr Spud used to make birthday and Christmas presents for his son from the loo-roll inner tubes. Mr Spud never had enough money to buy Joe all the latest toys, but would make him something like a loo-roll racing car, or a loo-roll fort complete with dozens of loo-roll soldiers. Most of them got broken and ended up in the bin. Joe did manage to save a sad looking little loo-roll space rocket, though he wasn’t sure why.

    The only good thing about working in a factory was that Mr Spud had lots of time to daydream. One day he had a daydream that was to revolutionise bottom wiping forever.

    Why not invent a loo roll that is moist on one side and dry on the other? he thought, as he rolled paper around his thousandth roll of the day. Mr Spud kept his idea top-secret and toiled for hours locked in the bathroom of their little council flat getting his new double-sided loo roll exactly right.

    When Mr Spud finally launched ‘Freshbum’, it was an instant phenomenon. Mr Spud sold a billion rolls around the world every day. And every time a roll was sold, he made 10p. It all added up to an awful lot of money, as this simple maths equation shows.

10p x 1,000,000,000 rolls x 365 days
a year = a lot of wonga.

Joe Spud was only eight at the time ‘Freshbum’ was launched, and his life was turned upside down in a heartbeat. First, Joe’s mum and dad split up. It turned out that for many years Joe’s mum Carol had been having a torrid affair with Joe’s Cub Scout leader, Alan. She took a ten-billion-pound divorce settlement; Alan swapped his canoe for a gigantic yacht. Last anyone had heard, Carol and Alan were sailing off the coast of Dubai, pouring vintage champagne on their Crunchy Nut Cornflakes every morning. Joe’s dad seemed to get over the split quickly and began going on dates with an endless parade of Page 3 girls.

    Soon father and son moved out of their poky council flat and into an enormous stately home. Mr Spud named it ‘Freshbum Towers’.

    The house was so large it was visible from outer space. It took five minutes just to motor up the drive. Hundreds of newly-planted, hopeful little trees lined the mile-long gravel track. The house had seven kitchens, twelve sitting rooms, forty-seven bedrooms and eighty-nine bathrooms.

    Even the bathrooms had en-suite bathrooms. And some of those en-suite bathrooms had en-en-suite bathrooms.

    Despite living there for a few years, Joe had probably only ever explored around a quarter of the main house. In the endless grounds were tennis courts, a boating lake, a helipad and even a 100m ski-slope complete with mountains of fake snow. All the taps, door handles and even toilet seats were solid gold. The carpets were made from mink fur, he and his dad drank orange squash from priceless antique medieval goblets, and for a while they had a butler called Otis who was also an orangutan. But he had to be given the sack.

    “Can I have a proper present as well, Dad?” said Joe, as he put the cheque in his trouser pocket. “I mean, I’ve got loads of money already.”

    “Tell me what you want, son, and I’ll get one of my assistants to buy it,” said Mr Spud. “Some solid gold sunglasses? I’ve got a pair. You can’t see out of ’em but they are very expensive.”

    Joe yawned.

    “Your own speedboat?” ventured Mr Spud.

    Joe rolled his eyes. “I’ve got two of those. Remember?”

    “Sorry, son. How about a quarter of a million pounds worth of WH Smith vouchers?”

    “Boring! Boring! Boring!” Joe stamped his feet in frustration. Here was a boy with high-class problems.

    Mr Spud looked forlorn. He wasn’t sure there was anything left in the world that he could buy his only child. “Then what, son?”

    Joe suddenly had a thought. He pictured himself going round the racetrack all on his own, racing against himself. “Well, there is something I really want…” he said, tentatively.

    “Name it, son,” said Mr Spud.

    “A friend.”

[Verse 1:]
He came riding in on the sunrise
Of a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say

Looks like you folks need some water
Well, water is my game
And for the small price of $100
I betcha I can make it rain

[Chorus:]
Step back, non believers
Or the rain will never come
Somebody start that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum

You know some may think
I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

[Verse 2:]
They all just stood there a-staring
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzie Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat

You say you call yourself a rainman
Well, you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Hey Lizzie
Well, a mans got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between

Oh, come with me, Lizzie
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you
Look yonder
There comes the rain

Don't think I can work, but I'll try
The car's in the shop, so I thumbed all the way
Oh, these days I barely get by

[Verse 2]
I walked home from work and it rained all the way
My wife left and didn't say why
She laid all her bills on the desk in the hall
Oh, these days I barely get by

[Verse 3]
Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose, and I cried
Oh, my boss says come winter, we'll all be laid off
Oh, these days I barely get by

[Bridge]
These days I barely get by
I want to give up, lay down and die
Worst of all was when she told me goodbye
Whoa, these days I barely get by
Whoa, these days, one barely gets by

But mine won't leave you
Until the sunlight has touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun

And then one winter day
His hand led hers away
She left you here drowning in your tears, here
Where you've stayed for years
Crying Lisa, Lisa

I'm not Lisa
My name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Until the sunlight has touched your face

You tell me how he was when you once knew him
He played his game with many women friends
You tell me that you don't think I'd be with him
If I could have known him way back then

You ask me why I don't pack up and leave him
Now that I know his wicked ways
Well' I doubt that you could understand my thinking
Well listen close to what I have to say

He's the rock that I lean on
He's the sunshine of my day
I don't care what you say about him
He took me and made me everything I am today
He's my rock and I ain't gonna throw him away

You say he wasn't always what he is now
He had to make mistakes like everybody else
Well don't you point your finger at nobody
It's plain to see you ain't no Saint yourself

He's the rock that I lean on
He's the sunshine of my day
I don't care what you say about him no I do not
Because He took me and made me the women I am today
He's my rock and I ain't gonna throw him away

Yes he's my rock and I ain't gonna throw him away

713,Eddie Rabbitt,17,Forgive And Forget,1975,"

When a man cheats on a woman
It's understood he's just a man
But when a woman cheats on her man
No one forgives

I drove her out into the night
With teardrops in her eyes
And only now I realize the fool I've been

Why couldn't I love her
And try to understand her?
Instead I said things that I regret
Why couldn't I just hold her
And say it didn't matter?
Why couldn't I forgive and forget?

It's not her fault she slipped one time
She never was the cheating kind
But when a woman's unsatisfied
She's bound to roam

But I got mad
I just saw red
I never heard a word she said
And what I'd give to have her back here in

Why couldn't I love her
And try to understand her?
Instead I said things that I regret
Why couldn't I just hold her
And say it didn't matter?
Why couldn't I forgive and forget?

Why couldn't I love her
And try to understand her?

Why couldn't I just hold her

Little Bo Peep
With a broom and a mop
A bulge in her cheek from a Tootsie Roll pop
Now who would believe that little girl is my wife

She looks like a child
But she's already grown
With everyday problems and kids of her own
And she is the main foundation of my life

Oh ain't she a picture of sunshine
Fresh as the breeze in the air
Right from her little girl dimples
To the ribbons of pink in her hair

But nighttime will find her a lady
And when that lady comes to me again
Well that's when my little girl pauses
And that's when my woman begins

She still throws a tantrum whenever she's mad
Cries at the movies whenever they're sad
And she pouts like a child when she doesn't get her way

But I wouldn't change anything for the world
I've spoiled her I know
But she's my little girl
And she makes everything alright at the end of the day

Now ain't she a picture of sunshine
Fresh as the breeze in the air
Right from her little girl dimples
To the ribbons of pink in her hair

But nighttime will find her a lady
And when that lady comes to me again
Well, that's when my little girl pauses
And that's when my woman begins

Yeah, ain't she a picture of sunshine
Fresh as the breeze in the air
Right from her little girl dimples
To the ribbons of pink in her hair

But nighttime will find her a lady
And when that lady comes to me again
Well, that's when my little girl pauses

I's thumbin' through the want ads in the Shelby County Tribune when this classified advertisement caught my eye. It said, ""Take imme-di-ate delivery on this '57 Chevrolet half-ton pickup truck. Will sell or swap for a hide-a-bed and thirty-five bucks. Call One-four-oh, ring two, and ask for Bob.""

Well, I called Bob up on the telephone, he says, ""Hello, this is Bob speakin'."" I says ""This here the Bob got the pickup truck for sale?"" He says, ""Yeah."" I says, ""Where are ya?"" He says, ""Fourteen east on County 12, turn right on the one-lane gravel road, you can park in the yard, beware of the dog, wipe your feet off, knock three times, and bring your billfold.""

Well, I tooled on east on County 12, turned right on the one-lane gravel road, and I parked in the yard and a German shepherd come out and grabbed onto my leg. Then I knocked three times and wiped my feet, the dog let go and the screen door opened and Bob come out and says ""Whaddya want?"" I says, ""Come to see your truck."" He says, ""Follow me. Come on, Frank."" (Dog's name is Frank.)

Well, we all went past the chicken house, through the hog pen, down to the tractor shed, and then wound up in back of the barn in a field of cowpies. And settin' right there in a pool of grease was a half-ton Chevy pickup truck with a 1960 license plate, a bumper sticker says ""Vote for Dick"" and Brillo box full of rusty parts, and Bob says ""Whaddya think?""

Well, I kicked the tires and I got in the seat and set on a petrified apple core and found a bunch of field mice livin' in the glove compartment. He says, ""Her shaft is bent and her rear end leaks, you can fix her quick with an oily rag. Use a nail as a starter; I lost the key. Don't pay no mind to that whirrin' sound. She use a little oil, but outside a' that, she's cherry.""

I says, ""What'll take?"" He says, ""What've you got?"" I says, ""Twenty-eight dollars and fifteen cents."" He says, ""You got a deal. Sign here, I'll go get the title and a can full of gas."" I put the nail in the slot and fired 'er up; she coughed and belched up a bunch a' smoke and I backed her right through the hog pen into the yard

Well, Frank jumped in and bit my leg and I beat him off with a crowbar. He jumped on out and the door fell off and the left front tire went flat. I jacked it up and patched the tube and Frank tore a piece of my shirt off. Then Bob come out and called him off and says ""You better'd get on out of here.""

I went left on the one-lane gravel road, went fourteen west on County 12. Took two full quarts of forty-weight oil just to get her to the Conoco station. And I pulled up to the Regular pump and then Harold Sykes and his kid come out. He says, ""I've seen better stuff at junkyards and where'd you ever get that truck?""

I says, ""That's a long story, Harold. I's thumbin' through the want ads in the Shelby County Tribune when this classified advertisement caught my eye. It said, ""Take imme-di-ate delivery on this '57 Chevrolet half-ton pickup truck. Will sell or swap for a hide-a-bed and thirty-five bucks...""

Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times (for the good times)

I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow...

Colder than ever like I don't own a sweater, my shit is on
Lately I'm into spending my paper until it's gone
Lately I'm into taking my paper and just investing it
Double all that cash, save again and spend the rest of it
Woah, that's a bad habit, I ain't got fame yet
But I ain't doing half assed shit just to take cheques
My long tees, my tattoos make 'em break necks
Getting me a late text from a chick I used a latex on
That's the shit that I do when I'm reckless
J be texting me like, “Homie, your tweets be too messed up""
Setbacks of being so close to being the next up
But I'ma take your fucking crown, so go 'head homie, fess up
Forget an only college crowd, I'm taking the globe
Not settling to make it rain, bitch, I'm making it snow
Nice little Porsche, rich boy, but we're making it show
We'll pull up in some Hondas and Uber cars taking your hoes
Boy, my life should be on brazzers, we lit
Live the life I fucking live, watch your attitude switch
Watch your happiness switch, I'm bout to be the next
Tell your favorite rapper that I'm at his neck
Fuck boy, what's up?

When I close my eyes
Feel like everything could change in a minute
I've been gone, baby, I've been on my business

You'll be gone, baby, you'll be on your business
Going hard, thinking bigger if you're living my life

Looking fresher than Philip Chong with some slippers on
Chilling in a villa with blonde bitches, ain't hitting bongs
And I be on my laptop, really focused on better shit
Focused on which Rollie I'm about to switch the bezel in
Shmoney dancing at your funeral, fuck it I'm on
Used to want these young girls, now try cop me a mom
Now settle down, grown men are speaking
You just a little tipsy, all my soldiers hella leaning
Trizz rolled the greatest shit, man, he hella weeded
Rap boys that party like rock stars, we hella tweaking
And if you bout that money talk, you better speak it
Or I ain't fucking with you, man, I got some fucking issues
I love stack making, that's my fucking problem

I knock it out like Pacquiao

I told him, ""Hit me back in bout five seconds""

Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Young folks roll on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door

[Verse 2]
Brother Gene is big and mean
And he don't have much to say
He had a little woman who he whooped each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night, kicked mamma down the stairs
But I'm all right, so I don't care

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doing fine
Shooting at the birds on the telephone line
Picking them off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher until I'm dead

[Chorus]

741,Elvis Presley,45,T-R-O-U-B-L-E,1975,"

I play an old piano from nine till a half past one
Tryin' to make a livin' watchin' everybody have fun
Well, I don't miss much that ever happens on a dance hall floor
Mercy, look what just walked through that door

Well, hello T-R-0-U-B-L-E
What in the world you're doin' A-L-O-N-E?
Say, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids
Told me not to stare cause it was impolite
And did the best she could to try to raise me right

But mama never told me 'bout nothing like Y-O-U
Say, your mama must have been another something or the other too
Say, hello good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well, you talk about a woman I've seen a lot of others
But too much something' and not enough another
You've got it all together like a lovin' machine
Lookin' like glory and walkin' like a dream

Mother Nature's sure been good to Y-O-U
Well, your mama must have been another good lookin' too
Say, hey, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well, you talk about a trouble-makin' hunka pokey bait
The men are gonna love and all the women gonna hate
Reminding them of everything they never gonna be
Maybe the beginning of the World War III
Oh, the world ain't ready for nothin' like a Y-O-U
Well, I bet your mama must have been another something or the other too

Say hey good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

742,Gary Stewart,46,She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles),1975,"

I've seen men look at her before
And they think I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But I'm only fooling me

I know she'll be looking back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere

She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles

I know what she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say an old friend

I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong

She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles

She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain

743,Billy Larkin,47,The Devil In Mrs. Jones,1975,
744,Moe Bandy,48,Don't Anyone Make Love At Home Anymore,1975,"

Of all the love affairs to die I wagered yours and mine
Would live to hear the golden chimes of time
But risking you led me into a world of cheatin' fools
A world that turned my heart away from you

Don't anyone make love at home anymore
Does everyone possess a yearn to cheat
Don't anyone make love at home anymore
Has everyone become a fool like me

[ steel ]

The crowd that I'm a part of now don't care what's right or wrong
Just choose the one you want and get it on
Nobody knows for sure who cheats or who's been staying true
Cause no one knows just who belongs to who

Don't anyone make love at home anymore...
Has everyone become a fool like me

"
745,Connie Smith,49,Why Don't You Love Me,1975,"

Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old

I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all of the riches you crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Take off the teardrops the heartaches and sorrow you'll save

When you are weary and tired of another one's gold
When you are lonely
Then think of this letter my own
Oh, but don't try to answer
Though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me
Then quite don't you leave me alone

Now as I am writing this letter
I think of the past
And all the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this old world
I'll soon say my farewells at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

"
746,Conway Twitty,50,Touch The Hand,1975,"

Today I heard my woman say something I never heard her say before
She just told me that she was going to leave me and that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the loving kindness and the understanding is still there somewhere
So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore

I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way
And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that your gonna leave me
And do things you've never done before

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore

The two lips that once held sweet surprises
Surprised me and said goodbye today
And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away
I know you believe you don't love me
Before you walk out that door

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman
Then tell me you don't love me anymore

"
747,Johnny Cash,1,One Piece At A Time,1976,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

[Chorus]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

[Verse 2]
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds

[Chorus]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mo-chine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
'68, '69, '70 automobile

748,Crystal Gayle,2,I'll Get Over You,1976,"

One thing 'bout this heart of mine
All my hurts got a mending time
It dont leave no scars behind
I'll get over you

I'll find me a guy one day
Who's not scared to give his heart away
When I do
It's safe to say that I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

From now on think
I'll lay low
I'll talk fast
But I'll move slow

You taught me all I need to know
'Bout gettin over you
Sometimes I think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
But I know it's just untill I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
Love for you's so hard to kill
But I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

Today I got a letter from someone
Just a friend we knew some time ago
And as I read between the lines
I began to realize he didn't know
I lost you a long, long time ago

[Verse 2]
Oh I just can't make it any longer
Everything I do is always wrong
I'm living a lie and there's no need in trying
To keep hanging on after all the good is gone

Lord, I wish that I could die
And there's no use in trying
To keep hanging on
After all the good is gone

750,Tanya Tucker,4,You've Got Me To Hold On To,1976,"

Don't it make life just a little more special
Knowing you've got someone who cares
You won't ever have to be lonely
Always have somebody there

Don't it make everything a little bit easier
Knowing you have someone like me
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see

That's when I like to stop and remind you
You've got me to hold on to, baby
Oh, you've got me to hold on to

Yes, and don't it make every chance
Worth taking even when you try and fail
Don't it make all the pain worth aching
Look around and find somebody there

Oh, don't it make everything a little bit easier
Knowing you have someone like me
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see

That's when I like to stop and remind you
You've got me to hold on to, baby
Oh, you've got me to hold on to

I've got you
I've got you

High and low
Happy or sad
You know I'm gonna be right there

Sharing your smiles
Drying your eyes anytime and anywhere
Cause you've got me to hold on to
Oh, you've got me to hold on to, baby
Cause you've got me to hold on to, honey

Don't pull your love out on me baby
If you do, I think that maybe I'll just lay
Me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me here to drown in my own tears

You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird
Gonna fly right out of here without a single word
But you know you'll break my heart
When I watch you close that door
'Cause I know I won't see you any more

(repeat chorus)
Haven't I been good to you
What about that brand new ring
Doesn't that mean love to you
Doesn't that mean anything
If I throw away my pride and I got down on my knees
Would you make me beg you pretty please

(Repeat chorus)
There's so much I want to do
I've got love enough for two
I'll never use it girl If I don't have you

(repeat chorus)
THEN YOU CAN TELL ME GOODBYE

Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you just wait a life time before you leave
If you must go, I won't say no
Just so we can say that we tried
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

752,Ronnie Milsap,6,What Goes On When The Sun Goes Down,1976,"

Sometimes love can sure get lost in the daytime
And working eight long hours you're only a picture in my mind
But when we're finally alone in each other's arms our love is found
And only lovers know what goes on when the sun goes down
What goes on when the sun goes down
Pillow talking love tangled sheets and cotton gowns
What goes on when the sun goes down
Makes the every day life of two people in love go round
Every morning with love renewed we face another day
Screen doors banging the boss complaining and bills to pay
Through it all we wear love's smile from the happiness we've found
And only lovers know what goes on when the sun goes down
What goes on when the sun goes down...
What goes on when the sun goes down...
Makes the every day life of two people in love go round

753,Elvis Presley,7,Hurt/for The Heart,1976,"

[Verse 1]
Take good care of her, take good care of her
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

[Verse 2]
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

[Verse 3]
I must accept it, she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy, that will be my consolation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

[Outro]
Take good care of her, take good care of her

754,'Billy Crash Craddock',8,Walk Softly,1976,"

Walk softly when you walk by me cause my heart is still don't shake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep don't wake it up don't wake it up
Now that I've cried my love to sleep don't wake it up don't wake it up

If I seem distant and reserved when you need don't take the time to ask me why
Cause it's bad enough that I've lost you
Don't make it rough just say hello and goodbye
Walk softly when you walk by me

I fall apart each time I look in your eyes remembering things I should forget
My love's a spark but it could burst into flames cause I'm not over you yet
Walk softly when you walk by me

755,Jimmy Dean,9,I.O.U.,1976,"

You know most people look through their wallets or their pocketbooks
And way down at the bottom Past the credit cards and baby pictures, greenstamps, you usually find a little old dog eared piece poetry

I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and I ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U.'s some of them thirty years overdue. Funny thing is that all these I.O.U.'s are owed to one person, and I kinda feel like right now might be a pretty good time for an accounting

Mom, you listenin?

Mom, I owe you for so many things, a lot of services, like night watchman for instance, for lying awake nights listening for coughs, cries, creaking floorboards and me coming in too late. You had the eye of an eagle, the roar of a lion, but you always had a heart as big as a house

I owe you for services as a short order cook, chef, baker, for making sirloin out of hamburger, turkey out of tuna fish and two big ol' strapping boys out of leftovers

I owe you for cleaning services, for the daily scrubbing of face and ears all work done by hand and for the frequent dusting of a small boys pants to try to make sure that he led a spotless life and for washing and ironing, no laundry could ever do. For drying the tears of childhood and for Ironing out the problems of growing up

I owe you for servics as a bodyguard, for protecting me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares ha, and too many green apples

And Lord knows I owe you for medical attention, for nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever
And let's not forget medical advise either, Oh, no
Important things like ha ha, don't scratching it or it won't get well
If you cross your eyes they're gonna stick like that And probably ah, most Important of all was, be sure you got on clean underwear boy, in case you're in an accident

And I owe you for veterinarian services, for feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope and for healing the pains of puppy love

And I owe you for entertainment, entertainment that kept the household going during some pretty tough times, for wonderful productions at Christmas, 4th of July and birthdays, and for making make believe come true on a very limited budget

I owe you for construction work, for building kites, confidence, hopes and dreams and somehow you made em all touch the sky

And for cementing a family together so it would stand the worst kinds of shocks and blows and for laying down a good strong foundation to build a life on

I owe you for carrying charges, for carrying me on your books for the necessities of life that a growing boy just gotta have. Things like, a oh, a pair of high top boots with a little pocket on the side for a jackknife

And one thing, Mom, I will never ever forget when there were two pieces of apple pie left and three hungry people I noticed that you were the one who suddenly decided that you really didn't like apple pie in the 1st place

These are just a very few of the things for which payment is long overdue, the person I owe em to worked very cheap
She managed by simply doing without a whole lotta things that she needed herself

My I.O.U.'s add up to much more than I could ever hope to repay
But you know the nicest thing about it all is that, I know that she'll mark the entire bill paid in full for just one kiss and four little words

Mom, I love you

"
756,Marty Robbins,10,El Paso City,1976,"

[Verse 1]
From thirty thousand feet above
The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl

I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city
I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run

[Hook 1]
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong, he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery in the song
That I don't understand

[Verse 2]
My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time?
And does the mystery deepen
Cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time?

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familiar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long
But I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

[Hook 2]
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be, that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago?

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Another voice, keeps tellin' me
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

El Paso City.....

Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see what you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't do our dreams
On suspicious minds

I saw an old friend I know I stopped to say hello
Would I could still see suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again you ask me where I've been
You can't see the tears are real I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Don't let a good thing die

Caught in a trap can't walk out...

759,Bobby Bare,13,The Winner,1976,"

The hulk of a man with a beer in his hand he looked like a drunk old fool
And I knew if I hit him right why I could knock him off of that stool
But everybody they said watch out hey that's the Tiger Man McCool
He's had the whole lotta fights and he's always come out winner yeah he's a winner
But I had myself about five too many and I walked up tall and proud
I faced his back and I faced the fact that he had never stooped or bowed
I said Tiger Man you're a pussycat and a hush fell on the crowd
I said let's you and me go outside and see who's the winner
Well he gripped the bar with one big hairy hand then he braced against the wall
He slowly looked up from his beer my God that man was tall
He said boy I see you're a scrapper so just before you fall
I'm gonna tell you just a little bout what it means to be a winner
He said now you see these bright white smilin' teeth you know they ain't my own
Mine rolled away like Chicklets down the street in San Antone
But I left that person cursin' nursin' seven broken bones
And he only broke ah three of mine that makes me the winner
He said now behind this grin I got a steel pin that holds my jaw in place
A trophy of my most successful motorcycle race
And each morning when I wake and touch this scar across my face
It reminds me of all I got by bein' a winner
Now this broken back was the dyin' act of a handsome Harry Clay
That sticky Cincinnati night I stole his wife away
But that woman she gets uglier and she gets meaner every day
But I got her boy that's what makes me a winner
He said you gotta speak loud when you challenge me son cause it's hard for me to hear
With this twisted neck and these migraine pains and this big ole cauliflower ear
And if it wadn't for this glass eye of mine why I'd shed a happy tear
To think of all that you gonna get by bein' a winner
I got arthritic elbows boy I got dislocated knees
From pickin' fights with thunderstorms and chargin' into trees
And my nose been broke so often I might lose if I sneeze
And son you say you still wanna be a winner
Now you remind me a lotta my younger days with your knuckles a clenchin' white
But boy I'm gonna sit right here and sip this beer all night
And if there's somethin' that you gotta gain to prove by winnin' some silly fight
Well okay I quit I lose you're the winner
So I stumbled from that barroom not so tall and not so proud
And behind me I still hear the hoots of laughter of the crowd
But my eyes still see and my nose still works and my teeth're still in my mouth
And you know I guess that makes me the winner

Maybe she was smiling in the mirror
Maybe I was too cause I was stoned
Singing every sad song on the jukebox one more time
Honey they were hitting close to home

And I said maybe this will make you think I'm crazy
Honey don't feel lonesome if you do
If you want to make a young man happy one more time
I'd sure like to spend the night with you

And she said stranger shut off the light and lead me

Somewhere shut off the shadows too
And while we lay there making believe you love me
Stranger could I believe in you?

Maybe you got all you got together
And maybe you keep rolling like a stone
Maybe some old lonesome song will take you by surprise
And leave you a little more at home

And she said stranger shut off the light and lead me
Somewhere shut off the shadows too
And while we lay there making believe you love me
Stranger could I believe in you?

The sound of your voice, your sweet hello
The fire inside me, when I'm holding you close

Your love's so warm and tender
Your thrill is so devine
Yet it's All These Things
That make you mine

If you would leave me, I surely would die
When you started to go, I started to cry
Now I've got it bad, but that's alright
As long as your near me every night

Your love's so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
Yet it's All These Things
That make you mine

You'd call me a fool
If I put on a top hat
And ran out to flag down the wind
I'd have to be weird
To grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do

[Chorus]
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

[Verse 2]
You know I
And I don't intend to
But should there come a day
When I say that I don't love you
They'll lock me away ay ay
It sure would be weird
To live in an envelope
Waiting along for a stamp
You'd swear I was loco
To rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp
And I may not be normal
But nobody is
So I'd like to say 'fore I'm through

[Chorus]
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

765,The Statler Brothers,19,Your Picture In The Paper,1976,"

I saw your picture in the paper Sunday mornin'
Lord, you sure looked pretty in your gown
The smile you were wearing, was the one I remember
And your hair was never prettier except when it was down

Yeah, I saw your picture in the paper Sunday mornin'
And to say the least it took me by surprise
I must've sit and looked at it for, Lord I don't know how long
Just thinkin' what was goin' on behind those eyes

I read the whole description
About the music and the bridesmaids
Huh, I'll bet your daddy threw a fit
When he had to get dressed up in that tux and tie

And I noticed where your sister came home from Texas
I know you were glad to see her
And knowin' your mama, she probably cried
But then so did I

I saw your picture in the paper Sunday mornin'
By then the honeymoon was almost through
So now you've made your bed and I hope you lie well in it
And I hope you'll both be happy, you see I still lie well too

I saw your picture in the paper Sunday mornin'

I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo
A-oo, a-oo, a-oo and I’m proud of it too
The red come from my grandpa an all American brave
The white come from my grandma she’s a red head Irish maid
The blue come from the man I love caused a bit before I said I do a-oo
That leaves me a mixed up breed of red, white and blue

I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo
A-oo, a-oo, a-oo and I’m proud of it too
I’m a blue-eyed Indian squaw every body calls me a half breed
That’s what you get when you sew a little red and a white seed
The white man said he’d marry me he lied cause babies do a-oo
That leaves me a mixed up breed of red, white and blue

I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo
A-oo, a-oo, a-oo and I’m proud of it too
The great white fathers had it planned to take the red man’s land
I think you think I’m prejudice but I’d never lie to you
There’s war-red blood running through my veins and I wish my skin was blue
I wish my skin was blue
I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo
A-oo, a-oo, a-oo
I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo
A-oo, a-oo, a-oo
I’m red white and blue a-oo, a-oo, a-oo

767,Mac Davis,21,Forever Lovers,1976,"

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

They checked into a small hotel
She blushed when he asked
For the bridal suite

Was the beginning of their lives together
Anxiously they'd waited for the moment
That their love would be complete

She reached inside
Her brand new traveling bag
And found her brand new negligee
And then she shyly slipped it on

And suddenly, he realized
The beauty of the tender prize
He'd waited for so long and finally won

She climbed into the bed
He snapped his fingers
Said, I've got to get champagne

There's a little store right down the block
I'll only be a minute, close your eyes
And, hon, I'll be right back again

And time goes by so slowly
She's not sure how much has passed
When she hears the siren
Screaming through the night

And seven hours later, they find her
Rocking on the bed
Just singing in the early morning light

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

She checks into the old hotel
And pays a little extra for the suite

She slips into the faded negligee
And brushes down her hair of gray
And lays her body down to wait

And the night air through the curtains
Makes a sound like someone breathing
And she reaches for him with her fingertips

And they find her in the morning
With tear stains on her pillow
And a smile like a kiss upon her lips

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
I knew I'd see you again

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

768,Billie Jo Spears,22,What I've Got In Mind,1976,"

There's a million things that we could do this evenin'
With all the night life and the silver screen
Oh, we've got time and we could take the town in
Or take a fast jet, baby, down to New Orleans

But what I've got in mind is a small cafe
Out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you

Well, I confess and you can find me guilty
I'm a selfish lover I can't deny
But I love you and I don't want to share you
With any night lights or darlin', in another's eyes

But what I've got in mind is a small cafe
Out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you

Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is makin' love to you

769,Bill Anderson & Mary Lou Turner,23,That's What Made Me Love You,1976,"

Two nights in the pourin' rain
In a motel in Dallas
That’s what made me love you
That's what made me love you

Champagne in a Dixie cup
You had a little and I had too much
That's what made me love you
That’s what made me love you

There ain't no way that time can make
A bad thing out of our love
In a hundred years I'll think back
And I'll have the memory of

A box of candy and a wilted rose
Wrinkled sheets and wrinkled clothes
That's what made me love you
That's what made me love you

Champagne in a Dixie cup
You had a little and I had too much
That's what made me love you
That's what made me love you

Two nights in the pourin’ rain
In a motel in Dallas
That’s what made me love you
That's what made me love you

Hello, Mr. Doodles
This is Ms. Doodles
I thought I'd call you up to say hello
And tell you that I miss you
And I wish that I were with you
But I guess I'm telling you something you already know

Well, how is California?
It's raining here in Nashville
Did you tell your ol' Mom and Dad I said hello
Yes, I've already double-locked the door
And I'm being careful
I just wished you'd hurry up and come on home

'Cause I don't know if I can get myself asleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like life's not touching me
And I'm just passing through
And now I realize how much you are me and I am you

Oh, nothing's really wrong
I just been working on that song so long
I don't know if I'll ever get it right
I drove out to the farm
And the roof is almost on the barn
And I just sat and watched the cows a little while

And wondered if a farmer and a city dude
Could make it there with me and you
Make that place feel like home
And be glad with it someday
I know we've gotta settle down
And quit our love this running 'round
And if that were you want to live with me
Then I guess it's ok

I'm just having a little trouble going to sleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like lives not touching me
And I'm just passing through
And now I realize how much you are me and I am you

Well it's bedtime, Mr. Doodles
I love you, Mr. Doodles
I guess I better say goodnight
Though I've had a busy day
Yes, I already double-locked the door
And I'm being careful
This old house and I just wishing
But I guess we'll be ok

Will you come home
And I can get myself to sleep with you gone
You know we're always together
And I don't know how to be alone
It's like life's not touching me
And I'm just passing through
And now I realize how much you are me and I am you

I'm content with loneliness if you're not in my arms
For my eyes can only see as far as you

And your love is strong enough to see me through
It'll keep me holding on to you forever
'Cause my eyes can only see as far as you

It'll keep me holding on to you forever
Cause my eyes can only see as far as you

Yes, My eyes can only see as far as you

Come on over

And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

When I cannot see in front of me
And I know my darkest day
Come on over
You can take it all away

And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around

The long lonely nights are now at an end

And left this morning
I don't know where she's gone
And most of all, I don't know why

I only know I've got the blues
I've never been this lonesome
It's enough to make a man
Lay down and die

Lone star beer and Bob Wills music
When I hear faded love, I feel at home
Love star beer and Bob Wills music
Have kept my heart alive since you've been gone

Got a pocket full of quarters
To feed to that old juke box
Bob Wills music helps
To keep that woman off my mind

Bartender keep that lone star comin'
Long as I got money
Cause I plan on bein' here 'til closin' time

And I replaced them, both large and small
And each new day finds me so blue
Because nothin' takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And I still love you when it's all said and done
Oh my darling, oh I'm so blue
Because nothin', oh nothin' takes the place of you

As I write this letter
Oh it's raining on my window pain
And I feel the need of you
Because without you, oh without you nothin' seems the same

So I'll wait until you're home
Oh I love you, yeah but you know I'm all alone
And oh my darling, oh I'm so blue
Because nothin', oh but nothin' takes the place of you

Oh nothin', oh but nothin' takes the place of you

'Cause its Georgia woman tastes like turpentine

If you don't want me woman you sure don't have to stall
For I can get more women than a passenger train can haul

I'd rather drink muddy water and sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy water and sleep in a hollow log
Than to be here in Atlanta, get treated like a dirty dog
Women make a fool out of me

If you're ever down in Mobile you can look me up
If you're ever down in Mobile be sure to look me up
And if you're ever in Atlanta tell Lucille to go to hell
Women make a fool out of me

783,Merle Haggard,37,Here Comes The Freedom Train,1976,"

[Chorus]
All aboard America here comes the freedom train[x2]

[Verse 1]
The freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
Two hundred years of glory never to turn back
The train is called America your ticket is a dream
That left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
She left the station in Lexington in 1776
And rode to Philadelphia where the Liberty Bell was fixed
George Washington was the engineer John Adams shovelled coal
And Franklin punched the tickets Tom Jefferson added soul

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
She rode to New Orleans the battle of 1812
With old Hickory at the throttle she drove the British out
The freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
Her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
Wheels of fortune sweaty Pittsburg rolled across the Mississippi
From Texas to Misourri to one real exciting trip
Then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
That blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Will Annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
Freedom train must never stop Republic never fall
To the bloody fields of Gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
She drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
Again the train rode westward to California shores
To the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
From Atlantic to Pacific she drove the rail with pride
She travelled a track to glory with the good Lord on her side

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There's much more to this story like Wilson and Roosevelt
They left the train to Truman who stoked it mighty well
Then old Dwight D. Eisenhower or LBJ we sing
Two brothers known as Kennedy and Martin Luther King
And still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
Straightened by the journey and the land beneath her rail
And you and I roll along and stroke the freedom fire
For we stand to all Americans hold old honour can't be hired

[Chorus]

784,Barbara Mandrell,38,That's What Friends Are For,1976,"

She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was the man who said our love would never end
When things went wrong, she'd tell us both to try again
That's what friends are for, that's what friends are for

And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
That's what friends are for, that's what friends are for

I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And I guess I should have known, there wasn't love enough for three
And now there's only me

So I'm alone, like I never thought I'd be
I trusted her, just as far as I could see
And she stole his love away from me
If that's what friends are for, I don't need them anymore

The first time that you went away without saying why
I was sure you’d come back if I just gave you time
You didn’t tell me goodbye so I waited by the phone
Then I lost you and being alone

One night you came walking in like I hoped you would
You put away your clothes and things like you were home for good
You stayed a while then you were gone without saying a word to me
There I was alone again

Here I am alone again
Fighting a battle I know that I can’t win
You came back just long enough to give me hope and then
Here I am alone again

Here I am alone again
Fighting a battle I know that I can’t win
You came back just long enough to give me hope and then
Here I am alone again
Here I am alone again

One, two, one, two, three go

All the girls all get prettier at closing time
Oh, they all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closing time
When the change starts taking place it puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars

If I could rate them on a scale from one to ten
I'm looking for a nine but eight could work right in
Few more drinks and I might slip to five or even four
But when tomorrow morning comes and I wake up with a number one
I swear I'll never do it anymore

All the girls all get prettier at closing time
Oh, they all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closing time
When the change starts taking place it puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars

I don't mean to criticize the girls at all
'Cause I'm no Robert Redford even overhauled
But we all picture in our minds a girl that looks just right
Now ain't it funny, ain't it strange the way a man's opinions change
When he starts to face that lonely night

All the girls all get prettier at closing time
Oh, they all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closing time
When the change starts taking place it puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars
The fallen angels of the back street bars

I'm gonna quit singin' all these sad songs

Oh, the life I sing about now
And the one I live is the same

When I sing them old songs of daddy's
Seems like every one comes true
Lord, please help me
Do I have to be the living proof

Why just the other night after the show
An old drunk came up to me
He says ""You ain't as good as your daddy, boy
And you never will be""

Then a young girl in old blue jeans
Says, ""I'm your biggest fan""
It's a good thing I was born Gemini
'Cause I'm living for more than one man

Remember Jimmie and Hank and Johnny
They were in the summer of life
When you called them away, Lord
I don't wanna pay that price

Don't let my son ever touch a guitar
May he never sing the blues
Let him be free
Don't make him be more living proof

I don't wanna be a legend
I just wanna be a man
But Lord, You know sometimes
I've needed a helpin' hand

And it ain't been so easy lately
I've had to go it all alone
But I've always had anything
I ever wanted, except a home

I'm gonna quit singin' all them sad songs
'Cause I can't stand the pain
Oh, the life I sang to you about
And the one I live is the same

Yes, I've sang those old songs of daddy's
And now it seems they all come true
Lord, please help me
Do I have to be the living proof

Lord, please help me
I don't wanna be the living proof

So, let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover

With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show

And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candlelights

And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face

So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away

Four car garage and we're still building on

We can't say we didn't try
But before we bury our love
Let's make sure we've let it die
Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things we used to say
If we're not back in love by Monday
We can go our separate ways

We could find that little cafe
With the funny sounding name
Get the table by the window
I'll say I love you once again
If the violin player's still there
We'll dance you until the break of day
If we're not back in love by Monday
We can go our separate ways

[Chorus]

"
799,Crystal Gayle,3,I'll Do It All Over Again,1977,"

Was I right?
Was I wrong?
A little too weak?
A little too strong?

Was it him?
Was it me?
Oh, I guess I'll never know

First you're up
Then you're down
Oh, but the world keeps turning around
Ain't it hard... to find...
Something to hang on to

But I know that my heart will mend
And I know that I'll smile again
I'll be back on my feet and then
I'll do it all over again

Some you lose
Some you win
They say that's the way it's always been

First you laugh
Then you cry
Oh, but I guess that's life

So you live, and you learn
And never look back at the bridges you burn
And you change, somehow
Oh, I'm a little bit wiser now

But I know that my heart will mend
And I know that I'll smile again
I'll be back on my feet and then
I'll do it all over again

But I know that my heart will mend
And I know that I'll smile again
I'll be back on my feet and then
I'll do it all over again
I'll do it all over again

"
800,Eddie Rabbitt,4,I Can't Help Myself,1977,"

Thought I was over you thought I could start anew
I got a new job, new friends on the other side of town
But here you are again just like a long lost friend
And when I touched your hand it started all over again

I can't help myself here comes that feeling
Just like a raging river rushing over me
No I can't help myself here I go falling
Head over heels falling for you again

Why does this heart of mine go crazy every time
When I know down deep inside you don't love me
But when you're standing there, wind blowing thru your hair
Well I'm starting to make the same old mistake again

I can't help myself here comes that feeling
Just like a raging river rushing over me
No I can't help myself here I go falling
Head over heels falling for you again
Head over heels falling for you again

"
801,Don Williams,5,Some Broken Hearts Never Mend,1977,"

Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day, like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

"
802,Barbara Mandrell,6,Married But Not To Each Other,1977,"

Ya know sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Specially when you and the one ya love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is

When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend every things alright
But it ain't, no it ain't

When you're married but not to each other
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
But you can't, no you can't

'Cause you're tied to her and I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
So what can you do, what can you do?

When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta be careful everywhere you go
Tryin' to avoid everyone you know
'Cause people talk, you know they talk

When you're married but not to each other
You've gotta make up alibis
Hopin' they don't sound like lies
'Cause if you get caught, and ya might get caught

Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
You better leave him

'Cause you're tied to her, I'm tied to him
We don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is, that's how it is

When you're married
But not to each other

Hurry up and love him
Hurry up and please him
And when it gets right
You've got to leave him
You better leave him

"
803,Tom T. Hall,7,Your Man Loves You honey,1977,"

Had my golf clubs on my shoulder when you saw me first today
Wearin' my old army sweater that you thought you threw away
And when you saw me standin' there you shook your head and sighed
When you saw I'd bought a sixpack I thought you were gonna cry
Your man loves you honey and I don't know what else to say
Your man loves you honey but you can't change my ways

Now before you say you're angry you remember what I did
Went to church with you last Sunday took your mama and the kids
Sat right up and heard the preachin' even wore my Christmas tie
I'm not much on organ music 5-strings banjo's more my style
Your man loves you honey...

Oh you should have had a knight in armor and a castle fair
Not some restless cowboy faded jeans and shaggy hair
I can't make it babe without you and you know that it's true
Keep me around for laughs so I've been good for one or two
Your man loves you honey...

They're tuning those twin Texas fiddles
It will soon be ""hold me"" time
I'm in such an easy mood

It's close to 4/4 time
All alone at a table for two
Just me and the candlelight
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

My last good time was in Dallas
We danced, every song
We promised each other forever
Forever didn't last that long

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

It's been so long since Dallas
Many lonely nights have come and gone
It may not last
But a dance or two
But it might last all night long

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

""Faded Love"" was playing
It could be the time was right
Shuffle with me, Houston stranger
It's a cowboy lovin' night

806,Mel Tillis,10,Burning Memories,1977,"

(Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries)
Tonight I'm burning old love letters photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better and when the smoke is gone I won't want you
Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries memories of you that I can't use
My heart to you no longer matters and I can't live on memories
Into the fire those dreams you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free
(Burning mem'ries burning mem'ries)

Solitaire. I'm gettin' good at solitaire
And I've got lots of times to spare
I'm gettin' good without you here
Telephone, I'm good at listenin' for the phone
I'm good at hopin' you'll call home
I'm good at listenin' for the phone
And I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you
I'm doin' well at cryin' too
I could be the best at bein' blue
I'm gettin' good at missin' you
Bedroom walls, I'm good at starin' at the walls
Dreamin' of your footsteps in the hall
I'm good at starin' at the walls
And I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you
I'm doin' well at cryin' too
I could be the best at bein' blue
I'm gettin' good at missin' you
Whoa, I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you
I'm doin' well at cryin' too
I could be the best at bein' blue
I'm gettin' good at missin' you...

808,Freddie Hart,12,Thank God She's Mine,1977,
809,Donna Fargo,13,That Was Yesterday,1977,"

You know, I've always believed
That when you feel something
Especially something good for someone
You shouldn't keep it from them
You should let him know
But I also believe that

If you think it's love
There's really no need to bring it up
If you know there's no chance for it to grow
But it seems like

I'm always coming up with contradictions
Because now I find that
What I believe and what I feel are two very different things
And those feelings
That I've kept all to myself are gonna come out now
Even though they've changed
So you see

I guess I was right in one way
That I never told you this
And I don't really know why I'm telling you now
But I'd just kinda like you to know that
There could have been a you and me
I might've changed my life for you

And you might've changed for me
If there weren't so many ifs and buts
And if you had wanted it to be
But because of the way I am
And the way you are
We never took the chance, did we?

Call it respect
Because we're not free
Call it fear of rejection
Because of our pride
Or call it just plain old common sense

That it would be just too risky
And too sticky a situation
Because we wouldn't know exactly where we were going
And we'd be afraid to take the ride

Call it whatever
But I wanted you to know that
I like you very much
And you're the kind of person I could love
You're honest, sincere, compassionate
Not afraid
To be too gentle and not afraid to be too strong

And you got that certain kind of something
People are always looking for and rarely find
And never seem to get enough of and somehow

It doesn't seem wrong to tell you that
No, we never kissed and never touched each other
But our hearts have and our souls have
And if we gaved them half the chance

Look out
For I'll bet they could start a fire
That nobody in the whole world could put out
But that was yesterday, wasn't it?

And things are so different now
So I was right not to ever tell you
Because I guess I always knew
It would of never really had a chance to grow
And though I'll use my better judgement again
And never mail this letter
I still kinda wanted you to know

"
810,Tammy Wynette,14,Let's Get Together (one Last Time),1977,"

Tomorrow you'll reach out and take my hand
And on my finger place a golden band
And somewhere on the other side of town
She'll stand beside you in her brand new wedding gown

You love her, I love him but here we are
The music's soft, the lights are dim

Let's get together one last time
Tonight's the night, it'll be alright
You can hold me tight till the morning light

She loves you and he loves me
Tomorrow night just won't be right, we won't be free

Let's get together one last time
'Cause we can't break the vows we'll make
So for old time's sake I'm yours to take
One last time, one last time, one last time

811,Dolly Parton,15,Light Of A Clear Blue Morning,1977,"

It's been a long dark night
And I've been a-waiting for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
You know I ain't seen it in so long
But everything's gonna work out just fine
And everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em
I've been like a captured eagle
You know an eagle is born to fly
Now that I have won my freedom
Like an eagle, I am eager to fly

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be ok

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

814,The Statler Brothers,18,I Was There,1977,"

When she bought her first heels I was there
When she combed those last pigtails from her hair
When she wore her sister's dress to the prom I must confess
When the last dance was danced I was there
When I first fell in love she was there I can still remember when and where
But life gives and takes and we all have our breaks
When she broke her first heart I was there

When she walked down the aisle I was there
When she took the vows to always love and care
With dignity and grace I quietly took my place
With the friends of the bride I was there
When they had their first fight and she called in the night
Though I knew it wasn't right I was there
And when he left her again and she needed a friend
Like a fool I've always been I was there
The last time we met he was there and whatever he thinks I don't care
I loved her first and he loved her worst I know she told me so when I was there
I know she told me so when I was there

815,Conway Twitty,19,Play Guitar Play,1977,"

Play, guitar play
Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling
Look a-yonder ya'll who's coming
Down the road, he's a coming home
But they know I never will

I left them living with that awful thing I done
I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run

Play, guitar play
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar, before I go
We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord, I wonder if they know

Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We got to climb that distant hill
I wonder if they think of me
(Guitar play)...

Your legs are curved you've got dainty feet I love it all

Head to toe  can't you see I love you
Head to toe  I can't get enough of you
I told you  now you know
I love you  head to toe

Your sparkling eyes  they shine with love
Your hungry lips  can't get enough
Your loving arms they're clinging vines
Your body's warm and when we're close I know it's mine

You're a hot country woman
And you sure know how to country please
Pretty woman of the country
Don't go city girl on me

You've got an eye for Cadillacs
And great big stacks of hundred dollar bills
You're like a hound dog chasing rabbits
And each sugar daddy's just another meal

Girl, you're playing with the big boys
Don't you realize that you're just little league
Pretty woman of the country
Don't go city girl on me

Pretty country woman
You got the bright lights in your eyes
But the true love I can give
Is worth more than all them uptown lights
And that good life
You've been looking for you ain't gonna find on city streets

I love you, woman of the country
So don't go city girl on me

If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made

I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly
Instead of writin' books and smilin' on TV

We'd all learn Cajan cookin' in Louisiana
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama
We'd put Florida on the right track, 'cause we'd take Miami back
And throw all them pushers in the slammer

Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
""Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes""

I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill

I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas
And I'd ban all the ones made in China
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild

I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia
'Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine

Hey, if the South woulda won we'd a had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
When Patsy Cline passed away, that would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we'd a had it made, olay he hee hee

Might even be better off

I saw roses choking in the grass
Flaking paint and a broken window pane
A mailbox barely standing by the driveway
I can almost see the name

A swing set and forgotten toys where
Little girls and boys played happy games
Everything I ever cared about is gone now
But the memory still remains

The old man from the house across the street asked
How's it going and I said fine
The expression on his face would make me think
He could almost read my mind

That Johnson boy from down the road was asking
If the kids could come and play
Lord I wish I could have told him yes but I
Just said I guess son not today

I just came home to count the memories
That I've been counting in my mind
I just came home to count the memories
From a better day and time

Birds that sang their pretty songs
Aren't singing like they did when we were here
Cause there's no happiness in music if somebody
Isn't close enough to care

I picked a ragged daisy from it's home
Out in the corner of the yard
She loves me she loves me not now I don't
Have to wonder anymore

I guess it's time to say goodbye

So you think you're quite a man
You're taking care of all her needs
Sometimes it's even twice a weekend
At least it's every time you need

Yeah, it's so easy now to swing
When the swing set feels just right
Like a fifty dollar room
Cheap perfume and candlelight

'Cause once you thought the thrill as gone
Your passion seemed to fade and die
You left a woman back at home
Alone and so unsatisfied

You hit the street to feel the thrill
Of the hunter in the night
Your prey was out there dressed to kill
In cheap perfume and candlelight

Cheap perfume and candlelight
The situation makes the man
If you can't make it back at home
You make it any way you can

And you can, it's so nice
That now you can

Maybe you'll never stop to think
Just for the true test did it be
Love your ever loving manhood of your masculinity

If you could satisfy the woman
Right back at home there every night
Instead of now and then
The girl in cheap perfume and candlelight

Instead of now and then
The girl in cheap perfume and candlelight
Instead of now and then
The girl in cheap perfume and candlelight

And I hope you're wishin' on that same bright star

I wonder
I pray
And I sleep alone
And I cry alone

And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please come home soon, come home soon

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I wear our lucky penny
Around my neck pressed to my heart

(And) I wonder
I pray
I sleep alone
I cry alone

And it's so hard livin' here on my own

I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder
I pray
I sleep alone
I cry alone

Without you this house is not a home
So please (come home soon)

I walk alone
I try alone
And I'll wait for I don't want to die alone
So please come home soon

Come home soon

Come home soon

As I've ever seen

And you're holding me tight
I can feel the invitation
I've seen in your eyes

And the soft light and the music
And the wine's rosy glow
Ain't making it easy
For me to say no

'Cause you're as tempting a woman
As I've ever seen
But there's someone in Dallas
Who's trusting in me

She's the mother of my children
I'm the rock she leans on
So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone

So thank you but no thank you
I'll be leaving alone

"
834,Mary Macgregor,38,This Girl (has Turned Into A Woman),1977,"

Wake up
The morning's over
The bed is soft and warm
Where we lay

I've dreamed the whole night through
Of how I'd say to you
All the things
My heart wants to say

Last night
You heard me crying
'Cause I had never loved a man
Before

And I guess the tears were falling
'Cause the little girl was lost
But now love
I'm not crying any more

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life

This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness
Last night

I've never a man
Lying on my pillow
I've never seen your body
Without clothes

I can't believe
These feelings I've discovered
Though I'm sure it's just
What every lover knows

Now I'm offering to you
I make a promise
And? Was gone tomorrow
Don't pretend

But right now I'm in love
And that's all I'm thinking of
And I hope this feeling
Never ever ends

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life
This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness last night

And I want to love you
Once again
Tonight

[David Frost]
The wave of dissent in America, occasionally violent, which followed the incursion into Cambodia by US and Vietnamese forces in 1970, prompted President Nixon to demand better intelligence about the people who were opposing him on the domestic front. To this end, the deputy White House counsel, Tom Huston, arranged a series of meetings with representatives of the CIA, the FBI, and other police and intelligence agencies.

These meetings produced a plan, the Huston Plan, which advocated the systematic use of wiretappings, burglaries, or so-called black bag jobs, mail openings and infiltration against anti-war groups and others. Some of these activities, as Huston emphasised to Nixon, were clearly illegal. Nevertheless, the president approved the plan. Five days later, after opposition from the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, the plan was withdrawn, but the president's approval was later to be listed in the articles of impeachment as an alleged abuse of presidential power.

Would you say that there are certain situations - and the Huston Plan was one of them - where the president can decide that it's in the best interests of the nation, and do something illegal?

[Richard Nixon]
Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.

[David Frost]
By definition.

[Richard Nixon]
Exactly, exactly. If the president, for example, approves something because of the national security, or in this case because of a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude, then the president's decision in that instance is one that enables those who carry it out, to carry it out without violating a law. Otherwise they're in an impossible position.

[David Frost]
The point is: the dividing line is the president's judgment?

[Richard Nixon]
Yes, and, so that one does not get the impression that a president can run amok in this country and get away with it, we have to have in mind that a president has to come up before the electorate. We also have to have in mind that a president has to get appropriations from the Congress. We have to have in mind, for example, that as far as the CIA's covert operations are concerned, as far as the FBI's covert operations are concerned, through the years, they have been disclosed on a very, very limited basis to trusted members of Congress.

[David Frost]
Speaking of the presidency, you stated: ""It's quite obvious that there are certain inherently government activities, which, if undertaken by the sovereign in protection of the interests of the nation's security, are lawful, but which if undertaken by private persons, are not."" What, at root, did you have in mind there?

[Richard Nixon]
Well, what I had in mind I think was perhaps much better stated by Lincoln during the war between the States. Lincoln said, and I think I can remember the quote almost exactly: ""Actions which otherwise would be unconstitutional, could become lawful if undertaken for the purpose of preserving the constitution and the nation.""

Now that's the kind of action I'm referring to. Of course in Lincoln's case it was the survival of the Union in wartime, it's the defense of the nation and, who knows, perhaps the survival of the nation.

[David Frost]
But there is no comparison, is there, between the situation you faced and the situation Lincoln faced?

[Richard Nixon]
This nation was torn apart in an ideological way by the war in Vietnam, as much as the civil war tore apart the nation when Lincoln was president. Now it's true that we didn't have the north and the south ...

[David Frost]
But when you said, as you said when we were talking about the Huston Plan, ""If the president orders it, that makes it legal"", is there anything in the constitution or the bill of rights that suggests the president is that much of a sovereign, that far above the law?

[Richard Nixon]
No, there isn't. There's nothing specific that the constitution contemplates. I haven't read every word, every jot and every tittle, but I do know that it has been argued that, as far as a president is concerned, that in wartime, a president does have certain extraordinary powers which would make acts that would otherwise be unlawful, lawful if undertaken for the purpose of preserving the nation and the constitution, which is essential for the rights we're all talking about.

[David Frost]
My reading of the transcript of the tapes tells me, trying to read them in an open-minded way, that the writing, not just between the lines, but on so many of the lines, is very, very clear - that you were in fact, endorsing at least the short-term solution of paying this sum of money to buy time. That would be my reading of it. But the other point to be said is: here's [John] Dean [White House Counsel] talking about this hush money, for [one of the Watergate burglars, E Howard] Hunt, talking about blackmail and all of that. I would say that you endorsed or ratified it. But let's leave that on one side ...

[Richard Nixon]
I didn't endorse or ratify it.

[David Frost]
Why didn't you stop it?

[Richard Nixon]
Because at that point I had no knowledge of the fact that it was going to be paid.

[David Frost]
What I don't understand about March 21 is that I still don't know why you didn't pick up the phone and tell the cops. You had found out about the things that [HR ""Bob""] Haldeman [White House Chief of Staff] and [John] Erlichman [Nixon's chief domestic advisor] had done but there is no evidence anywhere of a rebuke. But only of scenarios and excuses etc. Nowhere do you say we must get this information direct to whomever: the head of the justice department criminal investigation or whatever. And nowhere do you say to Haldeman and Erlichman ""This is disgraceful conduct"".

[Richard Nixon]
Well, could I take my time now to address that question. I think it will be very useful to you to know what I was going through. It wasn't a very easy time. Here was the situation I was faced with: Who's going to talk to these men [Erlichman and Haldeman]? What can we do about it? Well, first let me say that I didn't have anyone who could talk to them but me. It took me two weeks to work it out, tortuous long sessions, hours and hours of talks with them, which they resisted - we don't need to go through all that agony. And I remember the day at Camp David when they came up. Haldeman came in first. He said, ""I disagree with your decision totally"". He said, ""I think it's going to eventually ... you're going to live to regret it, but I will."" Erlichman then came in. I knew that Erlichman was bitter because he felt very strongly that he shouldn't resign. Although he had even indicated that perhaps Haldeman should go and he should stay.

I said, ""You know, John [Erlichman], when I went to bed last night I hoped, I almost prayed, that I wouldn't wake up this morning."" Well, it was an emotional moment; I think there were tears in our eyes, both of us. He said, ""Don't say that."" We went back in, and they agreed to leave. It was late, but I did it. I cut off one arm and then cut off the other.

Now, I can be faulted; I recognise it. Maybe I defended them too long, maybe I tried to help them too much, but I was concerned about them, I was concerned about their families. I felt that they, and their hearts felt that they, were not guilty. I felt they ought to have a chance at least to prove that they were not guilty. And I didn't want to be in the position of just sawing them off in that way.

And I suppose you could sum it all up the way one of your British prime ministers summed it up, Gladstone, when he said that the first requirement for a prime minister is to be a good butcher. Well, I think, as far as summary of Watergate is concerned, I did some of the big things rather well. I screwed up terribly on what was a little thing and became a big thing, but I will have to admit I wasn't a good butcher.

[David Frost]
You have explained how you have got caught up in this thing, you've explained your motives: I don't want to quibble about any of that. But just coming to the substance: would you go further than ""mistakes"" - the word that seems not enough for people?
What word would you suggest?

[Richard Nixon]
My goodness, that's a ... I think that there are three things, since you asked me. I would like to hear you say ... I think the American people would like to hear you say ... One is: there was probably more than mistakes; there was wrongdoing, whether it was a crime or not; yes it may have been a crime too. Second: I did - and I'm saying this without questioning the motives - I did abuse the power I had as president, or not fulfil the totality of the oath of office. And third: I put the American people through two years of needless agony and I apologise for that. And I say that you've explained your motives, I think those are the categories. And I know how difficult it is for anyone, and most of all you, but I think that people need to hear it and I think unless you say it you are going to be haunted by it for the rest of your life.

I well remember when I let Haldeman and Erlichman know that they were to resign, that I had Ray Price [Nixon's speechwriter] bring in the final draft of the speech that I was to make the next night and I said to him, ""Ray, if you think I ought to resign, put that in too, because I feel responsible."" Even though I did not feel that I had engaged in these activities consciously in so far as the knowledge of, or participation in, the break-in, the approval of hush-money, the approval of clemency etc, there are various charges that have been made. Well, he didn't put it in, and I must say that at that time I seriously considered whether I shouldn't resign, but on the other hand I feel that I owe it to history, to point out that from that time on April 30, until I resigned on August 9, I did some things that were good for this country. We had the second and third summits. I think one of the major reasons I stayed in office, was my concern about keeping the China initiative, the Soviet initiative, the Vietnam fragile peace agreement and then an added dividend, the first breakthrough in moving toward - not love, but at least not war - in the Middle East. And, coming back to the whole point of whether I should have resigned then and how I feel now, let me say I didn't make mistakes in just this period; I think some of my mistakes that I regret most deeply came with the statements that I made afterwards. Some of those statements were misleading. I noticed, for example, the managing editor of the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, wrote, a couple, three months ago, as far as his newspaper was concerned: ""We don't print the truth; we print what we know, we print what people tell us and this means that we print lies.""

I would say that the statements that I made afterwards were, on the big issues, true - that I was not involved in the matters that I have spoken about; not involved in the break in; that I did not engage in, and participate in, or approve the payment of money, or the authorisation of clemency, which of course were the essential elements of the cover-up - that was true. But, the statements were misleading in that enormous political attack I was under: it was a five-front war with a fifth column. I had a partisan senate committee staff, we had a partisan special prosecutors staff, we had a partisan media, we had a partisan judiciary committee staff, and a fifth column. Now under these circumstances, my reactions and some of these statements, from press conferences and so forth after that, I want to say right here and now, I said things that were not true. Most of them were fundamentally true on the big issues, but without going as far as I should have gone and saying perhaps that I had considered other things, but not done them. And for all those things I have a very deep regret.

[David Frost]
You got caught up in something and it snowballed?

[Richard Nixon]
It snowballed, and it was my fault. I'm not blaming anybody else. I'm simply saying to you that as far as I'm concerned, I not only regret it. I indicated my own beliefs in this matter when I resigned. People didn't think it was enough to admit mistakes; fine. If they want me to get down and grovel on the floor; no, never. Because I don't believe I should. On the other hand there are some friends who say, ""just face 'em down. There's a conspiracy to get you."" There may have been. I don't know what the CIA had to do. Some of their shenanigans have yet to be told, according to a book I read recently. I don't know what was going on in some Republican, some Democratic circles as far as the so-called impeachment lobby was concerned. However, I don't go with the idea that there ... that what brought me down was a coup, a conspiracy etc. I brought myself down. I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish. And I guess if I had been in their position, I'd have done the same thing.

[David Frost]
Could you just say, with conviction, I mean not because I want you to say it, that you did do some covering up. We're not talking legalistically now; I just want the facts. You did do some covering up. There was some time when you were overwhelmed by your loyalties or whatever else, you protected your friends, or maybe yourself. In fact you were, to put it at its most simple, part of a cover-up at times.

[Richard Nixon]
No, I again respectfully will not quibble with you about the use of the terms. However, before using the term I think it's very important for me to make clear what I did not do and what I did do and then I will answer your question quite directly. I did not in the first place commit the crime of obstruction of justice, because I did not have the motive required for the commission of that crime.

[David Frost]
We disagree on that.

[Richard Nixon]
I did not commit, in my view, an impeachable offence. Now, the House has ruled overwhelmingly that I did. Of course, that was only an indictment, and it would have to be tried in the Senate. I might have won, I might have lost. But even if I had won in the Senate by a vote or two, I would have been crippled. And in any event, for six months the country couldn't afford having the president in the dock in the United States Senate. And there can never be an impeachment in the future in this country without a president voluntarily impeaching himself. I have impeached myself. That speaks for itself.

[David Frost]
How do you mean ""I have impeached myself""?

[Richard Nixon]
By resigning. That was a voluntary impeachment. Now, what does that mean in terms of whether I ... you're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No. Now when you come to the period, and this is the critical period, when you come to the period of March 21 on, when Dean gave his legal opinion, that certain things, actions taken by, Haldeman, Erlichman, [attorney general John] Mitchell et cetera, and even by himself amounted to illegal coverups and so forth, then I was in a very different position. And during that period, I will admit, that I started acting as lawyer for their defence. I will admit, that acting as lawyer for their defence, I was not prosecuting the case. I will admit that during that period, rather than acting primarily in my role as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, or at least with the responsibility of law enforcement, because the attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer, but as the one with the chief responsibility for seeing that the laws of the United States are enforced, that I did not meet that responsibility. And to the extent that I did not meet that responsibility, to the extent that within the law, and in some cases going right to the edge of the law in trying to advise Erlichman and Haldeman and all the rest in how best to present their cases, because I thought that they were legally innocent, that I came to the edge. And under the circumstances I would have to say that a reasonable person could call that a cover-up. I didn't think of it as a cover-up. I didn't intend it to cover-up.

Let me say, if I intended to cover-up, believe me, I'd have done it. You know how I could have done it so easy? I could have done it immediately after the election simply by giving clemency to everybody. And the whole thing would have gone away. I couldn't do that because I said clemency was wrong. But now we come down to the key point and let me answer it in my own way about how I feel about the American people. I mean about whether I should have resigned earlier or what I should say to them now. Well, that forces me to rationalise now and give you a carefully prepared and cropped statement. I didn't expect this question, frankly though, so I'm not going to give you that. But I can tell you this ...

[David Frost]
Nor did I.

[Richard Nixon]
I can tell you this. I think I said it all in one of those moments that you're not thinking sometimes you say the things that are really in your heart. When you're thinking in advance and you say things that are, you know, tailored to the audience. I had a lot of difficult meetings in those last days and the most difficult one, the only one where I broke into tears, frankly except for that very brief session with Erlichman up at Camp David, that was the first time I cried since Eisenhower died. I met with all of my key supporters just the halfhour before going on television. For 25 minutes we all sat around the Oval Office, men that I had come to Congress with, Democrats and Republicans, about half and half. Wonderful men. And at the very end, after saying thank you for all your support during these tough years, thank you particularly for what you have done to help us end the draft, bring home the POWs, have a chance for building a generation of peace, which I could see the dream I had possibly being shattered, and thank you for your friendship, little acts of friendship over the years, you sort of remember with a birthday card and all the rest. Then suddenly you haven't got much more to say and half the people around the table were crying. And I just can't stand seeing somebody else cry. And that ended it for me. And I just, well, I must say I sort of cracked up. Started to cry, pushed my chair back.

And then I blurted it out. And I said, ""I'm sorry. I just hope I haven't let you down."" Well, when I said: ""I just hope I haven't let you down,"" that said it all. I had: I let down my friends, I let down the country, I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government but will think it is all too corrupt and the rest. Most of all I let down an opportunity I would have had for two and a half more years to proceed on great projects and programmes for building a lasting peace. Which has been my dream, as you know since our first interview in 1968 before I had any, when I thought I might win that year. I didn't tell you I thought I might not win that year, but I wasn't sure. Yep, I let the American people down. And I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life. My political life is over. I will never yet, and never again, have an opportunity to serve in any official position. Maybe I can give a little advice from time to time. And so I can only say that in answer to your question that while technically I did not commit a crime, an impeachable offence - these are legalisms. As far as the handling of this matter is concerned, it was so botched up, I made so many bad judgments. The worst ones mistakes of the heart rather than mistakes of the head, as I pointed out, but let me say a man in that top judge job, he's got to have a heart, but his head must always rule his heart.

You'd known so long that you were wrong but still you had your way
You told her lies and alibies and hurt her more each day
But now your conscience bothers you you've reached your journey's end
You're asking me for sympathy I'm sorry for you my friend

You laughed inside each time she cried you tried to make her blue
She tugged along through right and wrong because she worshipped you
You know that you're the one to blame there's no use to pretend
Today's the day you start to pay I'm sorry for you my friend
[ steel - fiddle ]
Today as she walked arm in arm at someone else's side
It made you stop and realize that time has turned the tide
You should have known you'd be alone cause cheaters never win
You tried and lost now pay the cost I'm sorry for you my friend

""Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."" Acts 26:28.

AND many there are who go thus far: ever since the Christian religion was in the world, there have been many in every age and nation who were almost persuaded to be Christians. But seeing it avails nothing before God to go only thus far, it highly imports us to consider,

First. What is implied in being almost,

Secondly. What in being altogether, a Christian.

I. (I.) 1. Now, in the being almost a Christian is implied, First, heathen honesty. No one, I suppose, will make any question of this; especially, since by heathen honesty here, I mean, not that which is recommended in the writings of their philosophers only, but such as the common heathens expected one of another, and many of them actually practised. By the rules of this they were taught that they ought not to be unjust; not to take away their neighbour's goods, either by robbery or theft; not to oppress the poor, neither to use extortion toward any; not to cheat or overreach either the poor or rich, in whatsoever commerce they had with them; to defraud no man of his right; and, if it were possible, to owe no man anything.

2. Again: the common heathens allowed, that some regard was to be paid to truth, as well as to justice. And, accordingly, they not only held him in abomination who was forsworn, who called God to witness to a lie; but him also who was known to be a slanderer of his neighbour, who falsely accused any man. And indeed, little better did they esteem wilful liars of any sort, accounting them the disgrace of human kind, and the pests of society.

3. Yet again: there was a sort of love and assistance which they expected one from another. They expected whatever assistance any one could give another, without prejudice to himself. And this they extended not only to those little offices of humanity which are performed without any expense or labour, but likewise to the feeding the hungry, if they had food to spare; the clothing the naked with their own superfluous raiment; and, in general. the giving, to any that needed, such things as they needed not themselves. Thus far, in the lowest account of it, heathen honesty went; the first thing implied in the being almost a Christian.

(II.) 4. A second thing implied in the being almost a Christian, is, the having a form of godliness; of that godliness which is prescribed in the gospel of Christ; the having the outside of a real Christian. Accordingly, the almost Christian does nothing which the gospel forbids. he taketh not the name of God in vain; he blesseth, and curseth not; he sweareth not at all, but his communication is, yea, yea; nay, nay. he profanes not the day of the Lord, nor suffers it to be profaned, even by the stranger that is within his gates. he not only avoids all actual adultery, fornication, and uncleanness, but every word or look that either directly or indirectly tends thereto; nay, and all idle words, abstaining both from detraction, backbiting, talebearing, evil speaking, and from ""all foolish talking and jesting""--eutrapelia, a kind of virtue in the heathen moralist's account; --briefly, from all conversation that is not ""good to the use of edifying,' and that, consequently, ""grieves the Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.'

5. He abstains from ""wine wherein is excess'; from revellings and gluttony. he avoids, as much as in him lies, all strife and contention, continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all men. And, if he suffer wrong, he avengeth not himself, neither returns evil for evil. he is no railer, no brawler, no scoffer, either at the faults or infirmities of his neighbour. he does not willingly wrong, hurt, or grieve any man; but in all things act and speaks by that plain rule, ""Whatsoever thou wouldest not he should do unto thee, that do not thou to another.""

6. And in doing good, he does not confine himself to cheap and easy offices of kindness, but labours and suffers for the profit of many, that by all means he may help some. In spite of toil or pain, ""whatsoever his hand findeth to do, he doeth it with his might;"" whether it be for his friends, or for his enemies; for the evil, or for the good. For being ""not slothful"" in this, or in any ""business,"" as he ""hath opportunity"" he doeth ""good,"" all manner of good, ""to all men;"" and to their souls as well as their bodies. he reproves the wicked, instructs the ignorant, confirms the wavering, quickens the good, and comforts the afflicted. he labours to awaken those that sleep; to lead those whom God hath already awakened to the ""Fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness,"" that they may wash therein and be clean; and to stir up those who are saved through faith, to adorn the gospel of Christ in all things.

7. He that hath the form of godliness uses also the means of grace; yea, all of them, and at all opportunities. he constantly frequents the house of God; and that, not as the manner of some is, who come into the presence of the Most High, either loaded with gold and costly apparel, or in all the gaudy vanity of dress, and either by their unseasonable civilities to each other, or the impertinent gaiety of their behaviour, disclaim all pretensions to the form as well as to the power of godliness. Would to God there were none even among ourselves who fall under the same condemnation! who come into this house, it may be, gazing about, or with all the signs of the most listless, careless indifference, though sometimes they may seem to use a prayer to God for his blessing on what they are entering upon; who, during that awful service, are either asleep, or reclined in the most convenient posture for it; or, as though they supposed God was asleep, talking with one another, or looking round, as utterly void of employment. Neither let these be accused of the form of godliness. No; he who has even this, behaves with seriousness and attention, in every part of that solemn service. More especially, when he approaches the table of the Lord, it is not with a light or careless behaviour, but with an air, gesture, and deportment which speaks nothing else but ""God be merciful to me a sinner!""

8. To this, if we add the constant use of family prayer, by those who are masters of families, and the setting times apart for private addresses to God, with a daily seriousness of behaviour; he who uniformly practises this outward religion, has the form of godliness. There needs but one thing more in order to his being almost a Christian, and that is, sincerity.

(III.) 9. By sincerity I mean, a real, inward principle of religion, from whence these outward actions flow. And, indeed if we have not this, we have not heathen honesty; no, not so much of it as will answer the demand of a heathen Epicurean poet. Even this poor wretch, in his sober intervals, is able to testify,

Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore;

Oderunt peccare mali, formidine poenae.

[Good men avoid sin from the love of virtue; Wicked men avoid sin from a fear of punishment.]

So that, if a man only abstains from doing evil in order to avoid punishment, Non pasces in cruce corvos, [Thou shalt not be hanged.], saith the Pagan; there, ""thou hast thy reward."" But even he will not allow such a harmless man as this to be so much as a good heathen. If, then, any man, from the same motive, viz., to avoid punishment, to avoid the loss of his friends, or his gain, or his reputation, should not only abstain from doing evil, but also do ever so much good; yea, and use all the means of grace; yet we could not with any propriety say, this man is even almost a Christian. If he has no better principle in his heart, he is only a hypocrite altogether.

10. Sincerity, therefore, is necessarily implied in the being almost a Christian; a real design to serve God, a hearty desire to do his will. It is necessarily implied, that a man have a sincere view of pleasing God in all things; in all his conversation; in all his actions; in all he does or leaves undone. This design, if any man be almost a Christian, runs through the whole tenor of his life. This is the moving principle, both in his doing good, his abstaining from evil, and his using the ordinances of God.

11. But here it will probably be inquired, ""Is it possible that any man living should go so far as this, and, nevertheless, be only almost a Christian What more than this, can be implied in the being a Christian altogether I answer, First, that it is possible to go thus far, and yet be but almost a Christian, I learn, not only from the oracles of God, but also from the sure testimony of experience.

12. Brethren, great is ""my boldness towards you in this behalf."" And ""forgive me this wrong,"" if I declare my own folly upon the house-top, for yours and the gospel's sake. --Suffer me, then, to speak freely of myself, even as of another man. I am content to be abased, so ye may be exalted, and to be yet more vile for the glory of my Lord.

13. I did go thus far for many years, as many of this place can testify; using diligence to eschew all evil, and to have a conscience void of offence; redeeming the time; buying up every opportunity of doing all good to all men; constantly and carefully using all the public and all the private means of grace; endeavouring after a steady seriousness of behaviour, at all times, and in all places; and, God is my record, before whom I stand, doing all this in sincerity; having a real design to serve God; a hearty desire to do his will in all things; to please him who had called me to ""fight the good fight,"" and to ""lay hold of eternal life."" Yet my own conscience beareth me witness in the Holy Ghost, that all this time I was but almost a Christian.

II. If it be inquired, ""What more than this is implied in the being altogether a Christian"" I answer,

(I.) 1. First. The love of God. For thus saith his word, ""Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength."" Such a love is this, as engrosses the whole heart, as rakes up all the affections, as fills the entire capacity of the soul and employs the utmost extent of all its faculties. he that thus loves the Lord his God, his spirit continually ""rejoiceth in God his Saviour."" his delight is in the Lord, his Lord and his All, to whom ""in everything he giveth thanks. All his desire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name."" his heart is ever crying out, ""Whom have I in heaven but Thee and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee."" Indeed, what can he desire beside God Not the world, or the things of the world: for he is ""crucified to the world, and the world crucified to him."" he is crucified to ""the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life."" Yea, he is dead to pride of every kind: for ""love is not puffed up"" but ""he that dwelling in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,"" is less than nothing in his own eyes.

(II.) 2. The Second thing implied in the being altogether a Christian is, the love of our neighbour. For thus said our Lord in the following words, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" If any man ask, ""Who is my neighbour"" we reply, Every man in the world; every child of his who is the Father of the spirits of all flesh. Nor may we in any wise except our enemies or the enemies of God and their own souls. But every Christian loveth these also as himself, yea, ""as Christ loved us."" he that would more fully understand what manner of love this is, may consider St. Paul's description of it. It is ""long-suffering and kind."" It ""envieth not."" It is not rash or hasty in judging. It ""is not puffed up;"" but maketh him that loves, the least, the servant of all. Love ""doth not behave itself unseemly,"" but becometh ""all things to all men."" She ""seeketh not her own;"" but only the good of others, that they may be saved. ""Love is not provoked."" It casteth out wrath, which he who hath is wanting in love. ""It thinketh no evil. It rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth. It covereth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.""

(III.) 3. There is yet one thing more that may be separately considered, though it cannot actually be separate from the preceding, which is implied in the being altogether a Christian; and that is the ground of all, even faith. Very excellent things are spoken of this throughout the oracles of God. ""Every one, saith the beloved disciple, ""that believeth is born of God."" ""To as many as received him, gave he power to become the sons of God. even to them that believe on his name."" And ""this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."" Yea, our Lord himself declares, ""He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life.""

4. But here let no man deceive his own soul. ""It is diligently to be noted, the faith which bringeth not forth repentance, and love, and all good works, is not that right living faith, but a dead and devilish one. For, even the devils believe that Christ was born of a virgin: that he wrought all kinds of miracles, declaring himself very God: that, for our sakes, he suffered a most painful death, to redeem us from death everlasting; that he rose again the third day: that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father and at the end of the world shall come again to judge both the quick and dead. These articles of our faith the devils believe, and so they believe all that is written in the Old and New Testament. And yet for all this faith, they be but devils. They remain still in their damnable estate lacking the very true Christian faith."" [Homily on the Salvation of Man.]

5. ""The right and true Christian faith is (to go on m the words of our own Church), ""not only to believe that Holy Scripture and the Articles of our Faith are true, but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation by Christ. It is a sure trust and confidence which a man hath in God, that, by the merits of Christ, his sins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God; whereof doth follow a loving heart, to obey his commandments.""

6. Now, whosoever has this faith, which ""purifies the heart"" (by the power of God, who dwelleth therein) from ""pride, anger, desire, from all unrighteousness"" from ""all filthiness of flesh and spirit;"" which fills it with love stronger than death, both to God and to all mankind; love that doeth the works of God, glorying to spend and to be spent for all men, and that endureth with joy, not only the reproach of Christ, the being mocked, despised, and hated of all men, but whatsoever the wisdom of God permits the malice of men or devils to inflict, --whosoever has this faith thus working by love is not almost only, but altogether, a Christian.

7. But who are the living witnesses of these things I beseech you, brethren, as in the presence of that God before whom ""hell and destruction are without a covering--how much more the hearts of the children of men"" --that each of you would ask his own heart, ""Am I of that number Do I so far practise justice, mercy, and truth, as even the rules of heathen honesty require If so, have I the very outside of a Christian the form of godliness Do I abstain from evil, --from whatsoever is forbidden in the written Word of God Do I, whatever good my hand findeth to do, do it with my might Do I seriously use all the ordinances of God at all opportunities And is all this done with a sincere design and desire to please God in all things""

8. Are not many of you conscious, that you never came thus far; that you have not been even almost a Christian; that you have not come up to the standard of heathen honesty; at least, not to the form of Christian godliness --much less hath God seen sincerity in you, a real design of pleasing him in all things. You never so much as intended to devote all your words and works. your business, studies, diversions, to his glory. You never even designed or desired, that whatsoever you did should be done ""in the name of the Lord Jesus, and as such should be ""a spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God through Christ.

9. But, supposing you had, do good designs and good desires make a Christian By no means, unless they are brought to good effect. ""Hell is paved,"" saith one, ""with good intentions."" The great question of all, then, still remains. Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart Can you cry out, ""My God, and my All"" Do you desire nothing but him Are you happy in God Is he your glory, your delight, your crown of rejoicing And is this commandment written in your heart, ""That he who loveth God love his brother also"" Do you then love your neighbour as yourself Do you love every man, even your enemies, even the enemies of God, as your own soul as Christ loved you Yea, dost thou believe that Christ loved thee, and gave himself for thee Hast thou faith in his blood Believest thou the Lamb of God hath taken away thy sins, and cast them as a stone into the depth of the sea that he hath blotted out the handwriting that was against thee, taking it out of the way, nailing it to his cross Hast thou indeed redemption through his blood, even the remission of thy sins And doth his Spirit bear witness with thy spirit, that thou art a child of God

10. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who now standeth in the midst of us, knoweth, that if any man die without this faith and this love, good it were for him that he had never been born. Awake, then, thou that sleepest, and call upon thy God: call in the day when he may be found. Let him not rest, till he make his ""goodness to pass before thee;"" till he proclaim unto thee the name of the Lord, ""The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin."" Let no man persuade thee, by vain words, to rest short of this prize of thy high calling. But cry unto him day and night, who, ""while we were without strength, died for the ungodly,"" until thou knowest in whom thou hast believed, and canst say, ""My Lord, and my God!"" Remember, ""always to pray, and not to faint,"" till thou also canst lift up thy hand unto heaven, and declare to him that liveth for ever and ever, ""Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee.""

11. May we all thus experience what it is to be, not almost only; but altogether Christians; being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus; knowing we have peace with God through Jesus Christ; rejoicing in hope of the glory of God; and having the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost given unto us!

[Verse 1]
I'm a game that you used to play
And I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
I'm a fire that burns in your mind

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
I'm a memory

[Verse 2]
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
I'm a memory

[Verse 2]
I'm a dream that comes in the night
And I'm a face that fades with the light
And I'm a tear that falls out of sight

Close your eyes
I'm a memory

844,Tompall Glaser,48,It'll Be Her,1977,"

Someday I think I'll take up thinking and try my best to understand
How she could be loving me forever and leaving on the other hand
Last night I thought I'd see a movie to help me get my thoughts in hand
I think what I saw was the western preacher or James Bond on the other hand
I placed the ring upon one finger of her left hand
The one who said she'd stay forever is gone on the other hand
(This is Joe Talbott on the Hawaiian steel guitar)
[ steel ]
But today the world looks brighter I feel just like a brand new man
I love her no longer I don't miss her I'm lying on the other hand
She's gone I know I'm being foolish I should act like a grown up man
But things could get worse I could start crying I do on the other hand
I placed the ring upon one finger...
The one who said she'd stay forever is gone on the other hand

[Verse 1]
Nibbling on sponge cake
Watching the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strumming my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they're beginning to boil

[Chorus]
Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

[Verse 2]
Don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

[Chorus]
Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

[Verse 3]
I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there’s booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

[Chorus]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
But I know it’s my own damn fault

Yes, and some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
And I know it’s my own damn fault

847,The Statler Brothers,1,Do You Know You Are My Sunshine,1978,"

She was standing in the crowd
All alone and lookin` pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made

Do you know, `You Are My Sunshine`?
She asked so sweet and tenderly
Do you know, `You Are My Sunshine`
And would you do it one more time for me

Border to border
And ocean to ocean
I still look for her everplace
Chasing the sunshine
Each and every night I`m
Searching every crowd for her face

She was gone just as quick
As the song that she asked for
Taking my sunshine away
But someday when I finally
Look down and see her
I know just what I`m going to say

Do you know, you are my sunshine
Do you know what your smile did to me
Do you know, you are my sunshine
And it looks like you`re always going to be

Most of my life I've almost been a winner
I've come so close but never really won
Just when I thought I finally made it
I found myself back where I started from

[Chorus]
I hate to say I'm giving up but I believe
Losing's just become a way of life for me
Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

[Verse 2]
Then you came along and had me had me believing
For once in my life my luck had finally changed
And now you say you're going to leave me
Seems everything I do winds up the same

Losing wouldn't be so bad at all
But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

An' just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

[Chorus]
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

She Can Put Her Shoes Under My Bed Anytime - Johnny Duncan

She can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Matter of fact she can move right into my life and stay

We became buddies a long time ago
So I'm gonna tell something I think you should know
Now you don't recognize what's right before your eyes
The best you ever had you're gonna blow

You've got a girl that loves you she could never be untrue
And buddy let me say that's more than I can say for you
If givin' her some happiness is messing up your plans
I'd be more than happy to take her off your hands

I mean that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime she's ready, mmm, it'll be okay
And she can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my life and stay

Now you don't have to listen, just keep doing what you do
She's only one more hurt away, boy, from walking out on you
But if you want to keep her, one thing you better know
Once she gets to walking, she won't have far to go

You know that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime that woman's ready, mmm, it's more than okay
And she can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my house and stay

She can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime she's ready well that'll be okay
And she can have the key to my ..... fade....

851,Willie Nelson,5,If You Can Touch Her At All,1978,"

[Verse 1]
Funny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by my bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold

[Chorus]
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all

[Verse 2]
Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes

[Chorus]
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
Sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might have set the West Coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind

But it's all right because it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight it just up and put me down
Well I ain't going to let it bother me today
I've been working and I'm too tired anyway

But it's all right because it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

Well I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West LA

He met her in a honky tonk
Singing country songs that he wrote
She sat at a table
Listening to his music and drinking coke
Well, he sat down beside her
Said, honey, what's your name
She said I like your music, sir
But foolin' 'round is certainally not my game

When the small talk was over
The cowboy drank his beer and took her home
Lust on his mind
In a bedroom he had her all alone
And when the night was over
The cowboy shook his head
'Cause she slept on the sofa
And the cowboy slept alone on his bed

She still sees the cowboy
On the country shows and sometimes on T.V
He phones her up and talks to her long distance
From wherever he might be
He'll ask her how she's doin'
She'll reply by sayin', oh, just fine
And the moral of this story is
Cowboys don't get lucky all the time
And the moral of this story is
Cowboys don't get lucky all the time

They met upon a blue moon
And they parted on a cloudy day
They were so in love and out of school
But he was goin' so far, far away

She said: ""I'll be true to you
""Even though you don't want me to
""And I'll be blue for you
""Even though you've asked me not to.""

Well the year's drifted by them, as we all know they can
He found other women, but she refused other men
But as fate would have it, they met again
She was on a down-hill slide, he was just slidin' in

As he looked into her eyes that night, he never realized
The only real love in his life was passin' by
When he turned and left her there, his words: ""Goodbye""
He heard her calling out to him, and as he walked, she cried:

""I've been true to you
""Seems like speakin' to me is the least that you could do
""And I've been blue for you
""Even though you've asked me not to.""

She'd been drinkin way too hard one night
She'd been drinkin way too long
Alone and pale in a cheap hotel, she died there in the dawn
Kneelin' by the grave, oh so late and oh so wrong
He longed to hold her close again, cryin' on and on

He cried: ""I'll be true to you
""After all that I have put you through
""And I'll be blue for you
""Though you never even asked me to.""

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face

I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on, now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
(Hey, hey)

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart

And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me with somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you

And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me

Go on, now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now

Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

868,Mel Tillis,22,I Believe In You,1978,"

The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He laied to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich Uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil
Listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like that
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owes me forty bucks

Let me be your baby, hold me close tonight
Kiss away the teardrops till the mornin' light
Help a lonely lady make it through the night
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all right

Rock me in the cradle of your lovin' arms
Wrap your love around me, keep me safe and warm
Tell a bedtime story and gently tuck me in
Let me be your baby, don't let me be alone again

Be my lovin' daddy and sing a lullaby
Promise me you'll never make your baby cry

Help a lonely lady make it through the night
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all right
Let me be your baby, tell me it'll be all right

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone

Jesus loves me

How great thou art you saved my soul

There's angels watching over me
So gather round
And clap your hands
For Jesus, the Wolfman and the angel band

876,Bobby Bare,30,Too Many Nights Alone,1978,"

Midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And motel rooms have been my only home
They gave me these sad knowing eyes and old age lines before my time
I guess I spent too many nights alone
Denver trains and LA games taxis through the New York rain
On everybody's party but my own
Tellin' myself love could wait now maybe girl you've come too late
I may have spent too many nights alone
I never let nobody any closer than my body and I never needed someone till now
And you know I want so much to reach out my soul and touch you
But I don't know if I know how
Cause midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And open roads have been my only home
Learnin' ways to say goodbye and songs that only make me cry
I guess I spent too many nights alone too many nights alone

This is the end I guess we've said goodbye
I'll miss you I'll confess but I won't cry
How can you leave me so lonesome and blue
This is the thanks I get for loving you

How can you leave me so lonesome and blue
This is the thanks I get for loving you...

Monday's promise is Tuesday's lie
Saturday's party is Sunday's fight
Somethin's wrong with you and I
Love's gone wrong that used to be right

And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away

Wednesday's kisses are Thursday's frowns
We can't live two days in a row
When our world's not upside down
Here we stand watchin' it go

And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away

Roses are red, violets are blue
Sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzle's missin' a piece or two
We've got the grapes but never the wine

And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away

And I can feel it slippin' away
Slowly, slowly slippin' away
It'll be gone in a few more days
If we don't stop this love of ours
From slippin' away

For the only man I ever loved
Has gone on the morning train

Well the train pulled out
The whistle blew
With a long and a lonesome moan
He's gone he's gone
Like the morning dew
And left me all alone

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

Well there's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young man's heart
But never a change in mine

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife

Across the bay a lady waits to hold me tight
And my boat and I are ready to set sail
If the weather keeps on holdin' and the wind is right

And we will sail away on the wings of love into the night
Cast out our fortunes on the sea
Then we will go to sleep together with the rocking of the water
And dream of how our life will someday be
When she sails away with me

As I skip across the waves my sails are high and full
My mind is on the one I wait to see
And I dream about an island somewhere in my mind
Where someday I will take her off with me

And we will sail away on the wings of love into the night
Cast out our fortunes on the sea
Then we will go to sleep together with the rocking of the water
And dream of how our life will someday be
When she sails away with me

Then a smile comes upon me as I look across the bow;
I see a lady on the side
But she will wait no more as I head for the shore
Cause tonight I'm gonna take her for a ride

I can put my makeup on and drive the men insane

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

There's questions we're always hearing every where we go
Like how do I cut a record or get on a country show
Well, it takes more than just ambition and three chords on an old guitar
There's a few more things you ought to learn to be a country star

You got to learn to sing like Waylon or pick like Jerry Reed
Yodel like Jeannie Shepard, write songs like Tom T
Put a cry in your voice like Haggard, learn Spanish like Johnny R
Whisper like Bill Anderson and you'll be a country star

Play piano like Ronnie Mil sap or Gilly or Jerry Lee
Yo-yo like Roy Acuff or talk plain like Ralph Emery
Growl like Conway Twitty, get a red, white and blue guitar
Build a swimming pool like Webb did and you'll be a country star

Be tall like Sonny James is, tell jokes like Minnie Pearl
Or be short like Jimmy Dickens or play five-string like Earl
Get a hip band like Willie, learn to stutter like M-Mel
Get a cap like Roy Clark wore or a voice like Barbara Mandrel

Be rich like Eddy Arnold, say you're makin' more than you are
Get a gimmick like Charley Pride got and you'll be a country star

But if you have no talent and you're not a male
If you're built somewhat like Dolly or have a face like Crystal Gayle
Come back stage and ask for Harold, Phil, Don or Lou
And we'll see you get auditioned for the Statler Brothers Review

(He made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20, 1927. He took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York and landed near Paris, France. The flight took thirty three and a half hours. Of course, he had to be awake the entire time, and alert enough to pilot a plane.)
""Today, paniced investors ordered their brokers to sell at whatever the price in the stock market crashed.""
(In October, 1929, an over-valued stock market, with many owning shares purchased ""on margin"" or with borrowed money, crashed. Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now. The insurance companies began to exclude suicide as an acceptable cause of death for life insurance policies and/or wrote in a two year waiting period before benefits could be paid.)

""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" - PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
(From his first Inaugural Address, 3/4/33. In the depths of the Great Depression, the pessimism of the population and especially the business community kept things bad. Decisions based on a gloomy outlook caused things to get even worse. In that respect, the mood and expectation of bad times became a self-fulfilling prophecy.)

""Horrific place, ladies and gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, ooh, the humanity""
(Live radio account of the fire and crash of the German airship ""Hindenburg."" It happened 5/6/37 on the eve of the Second World War in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever built. It was filled with an enormous quantity of hydrogen. Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face

I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on, now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
(Hey, hey)

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart

And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me with somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you

And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me

Go on, now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
(Oh)

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one who tried
To break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive

Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
And now that leaving you has come
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

You're so late with your new plans for two
He had lots of nights to love me away from you
But the first time that he touched me, I was sure
When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

Elizabeth



1586

The dangers which arose from the character, principles, and pretensions of the queen of Scots, had very early engaged Elizabeth to consult, in her treatment of that unfortunate princess, the dictates of jealousy and politics, rather than of friendship or generosity: resentment of this usage had pushed Mary into enterprises which had nearly threatened the repose and authority of Elizabeth: the rigor and restraint thence redoubled upon the captive queen,[*] still impelled her to attempt greater extremities; and while her impatience of confinement, her revenge,[**] 20 and her high spirit concurred with religious zeal, and the suggestions of desperate bigots, she was at last engaged in designs which afforded her enemies, who watched the opportunity, a pretence or reason for effecting her final ruin.

       &nbsp* Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p. 607.

       &nbsp** See note T. at the end of the volume.

The English seminary at Rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch of rage and animosity against the queen. The recent persecutions from which they had escaped; the new rigors which they knew awaited them in the course of their missions; the liberty which for the present they enjoyed of declaiming against that princess; and the contagion of that religious fury which every where surrounded them in France; all these causes had obliterated with them every maxim of common sense, and every principle of morals or humanity. Intoxicated with admiration of the divine power and infallibility of the pope, they revered his bull by which he excommunicated and deposed the queen; and some of them had gone to that height of extravagance as to assert, that that performance had been immediately dictated by the Holy Ghost. The assassination of heretical sovereigns, and of that princess in particular, was represented as the most meritorious of all enterprises; and they taught, that whoever perished in such pious attempts, enjoyed, without dispute, the glorious and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By such doctrines, they instigated John Savage, a man of desperate courage, who had served some years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma, to attempt the life of Elizabeth; and this assassin, having made a vow to persevere in his design, was sent over to England, and recommended to the confidence of the more zealous Catholics.

       &nbspAbout the same time, John Ballard, a priest of that seminary, had returned to Paris from his mission in England and Scotland; and as he had observed a spirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent among the Catholic devotees in these countries, he had founded on that disposition the project of dethroning Elizabeth, and of restoring by force of arms the exercise of the ancient religion.[*] The situation of affairs abroad seemed favorable to this enterprise; the pope, the Spaniard, the duke of Guise, concurring in interests, had formed a resolution to make some attempt against England: and Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador at Paris, strongly encouraged Ballard to hope for succors from these princes. Charles Paget alone, a zealous Catholic and a devoted partisan of the queen of Scots, being well acquainted with the prudence, vigor, and general popularity of Elizabeth, always maintained that, so long as that princess was allowed to live, it was in vain to expect any success from an enterprise upon England. Ballard, persuaded of this truth, saw more clearly the necessity of executing the design formed at Rheims; he came over to England in the disguise of a soldier, and assumed the name of Captain Fortescue; and he bent his endeavors to effect at once the project of an assassination, an insurrection, and an invasion.[**]

       &nbsp* Murden's State Papers, p. 517.

       &nbsp* Camden, p. 515

The first person to whom he addressed himself was Anthony Babington, of Dethic, in the county of Derby. This young gentleman was of a good family, possessed a plentiful fortune, had discovered an excellent capacity, and was accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station. Being zealously devoted to the Catholic communion, he had secretly made a journey to Paris some time before, and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas Morgan, a bigoted fugitive from England, and with the bishop of Glasgow, Mary's ambassador at the court of France. By continually extolling the amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that princess, they impelled the sanguine and unguarded mind of young Babington to make some attempt for her service; and they employed every principle of ambition, gallantry, and religious zeal, to give him a contempt of those dangers which attended any enterprise against the vigilant government of Elizabeth. Finding him well disposed for their purpose, they sent him back to England, and secretly, unknown to himself, recommended him to the queen of Scots, as a person worth engaging in her service. She wrote him a letter, full of friendship and confidence; and Babington, ardent in his temper and zealous in his principles, thought that these advances now bound him in honor to devote himself entirely to the service of that unfortunate princess. During some time, he had found means of conveying to her all her foreign correspondence; but after she was put under the custody of Sir Amias Paulet, and reduced to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced so much difficulty and danger in rendering her this service, that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature.

When Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington, he found his zeal suspended, not extinguished: his former ardor revived on the mention of any enterprise which seemed to promise success in the cause of Mary and of the Catholic religion. He had entertained sentiments conformable to those of Paget, and represented the folly of all attempts which, during the lifetime of Elizabeth, could be formed against the established religion and government of England. Ballard, encouraged by this hint, proceeded to discover to him the design undertaken by Savage;[*] and was well pleased to observe that, instead of being shocked with the project, Babington only thought it not secure enough, when intrusted to one single hand, and proposed to join five others with Savage in this desperate enterprise.

       &nbsp* Camden, p. 515. State Trials, p. 114.

In prosecution of these views, Babington employed himself in increasing the number of his associates; and he secretly drew into the conspiracy many Catholic gentlemen, discontented with the present government. Barnwell, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc, a gentleman of Lancashire, and Abington, whose father had been cofferer to the household readily undertook the assassination of the queen. Charles Tilney, the heir of an ancient family, and Titchborne of Southampton, when the design was proposed to them, expressed some scruples, which were removed by the arguments of Babington and Ballard. Savage alone refused, during some time, to share the glory of the enterprise with any others;[*] he challenged the whole to himself; and it was with some difficulty he was induced to depart from this preposterous ambition.

       &nbsp* State Trials, vol. i. p. 111.

The deliverance of the queen of Scots, at the very same instant when Elizabeth should be assassinated, was requisite for effecting the purpose of the conspirators; and Babington undertook, with a party of a hundred horse, to attack her guards while she should be taking the air on horseback. In this enterprise, he engaged Edward Windsor, brother to the lord of that name, Thomas Salisbury, Robert Gage, John Travers, John Jones, and Henry Donne; most of them men of family and interest. The conspirators much wanted, but could not find, any nobleman of note whom they might place at the head of the enterprise; but they trusted that the great events, of the queen's death and Mary's deliverance, would rouse all the zealous Catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking advantage of the general confusion, would easily fix the queen of Scots on the throne, and reestablish the ancient religion.

These desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth's council, particularly of Walsingham, secretary of state. That artful minister had engaged Maud, a Catholic priest, whom he retained in pay, to attend Ballard in his journey to France, and had thereby got a hint of the designs entertained by the fugitives. Polly, another of his spies, had found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in England; and, though not entirely trusted, had obtained some insight into their dangerous secrets. But the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known, till Gifford, a seminary priest, came over and made a tender of his services to Walsingham. By his means, the discovery became of the utmost importance, and involved the fate of Mary, as well as of those zealous partisans of that princess.

Babington and his associates, having laid such a plan as, they thought, promised infallible success, were impatient to communicate the design to the queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation and concurrence. For this service they employed Gifford, who immediately applied to Walsingham, that the interest of that minister might forward his secret correspondence with Mary. Walsingham proposed the matter to Paulet, and desired him to connive at Gifford's corrupting one of his servants; but Paulet, averse to the introducing of such a pernicious precedent into his family, desired that they would rather think of some other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who supplied the family with ale; and bribed him to convey letters to the captive queen. The letters, by Paulet's connivance, were thrust through a chink in the wall; and answers were returned by the same conveyance.

Ballard and Babington were at first diffident of Gifford's fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave him only blank papers made up like letters; but finding by the answers that these had been faithfully delivered, they laid aside all further scruple, and conveyed by his hands the most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy. Babington informed Mary of the design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an insurrection at home, the scheme for her deliverance, and the conspiracy for assassinating the usurper, by six noble gentlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private friends; who, from the zeal which they bore to the Catholic cause and her majesty's service, would undertake the ""tragical execution."" Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design; that the gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it should ever be in her power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary circumstance, before any attempts were made, either for her own deliverance or an insurrection.[*]

       &nbsp* State Trials, vol. i. p 135. Camden, p. 515.

These letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget, the archbishop of Glasgow, and Sir Francis Inglefield, were carried by Gifford to Secretary Walsingham; were deciphered by the art of Philips, his clerk; and copies taken of them. Walsingham employed another artifice, in order to obtain full insight into the plot: he subjoined to a letter of Mary's a postscript in the same cipher; in which he made her desire Babington to inform her of the names of the conspirators. The indiscretion of Babington furnished Walsingham with still another means of detection, as well as of defence. That gentlemen had caused a picture to be drawn, where he himself was represented standing amidst the six assassins; and a motto was subjoined, expressing that their common perils were the band of their confederacy. A copy of this picture was brought to Elizabeth, that she might know the assassins, and guard herself against their approach to her person.

Meanwhile Babington, anxious to insure and hasten the foreign succors, resolved to despatch Ballard into France; and he procured for him, under a feigned name, a license to travel. In order to remove from himself all suspicion, he applied to Walsingharn, pretended great zeal for the queen's service, offered to go abroad, and professed his intentions of employing the confidence which he had gained among the Catholics, to the detection and disappointment of their conspiracies. Walsingham commended his loyal purposes; and promising his own counsel and assistance in the execution of them, still fed him with hopes, and maintained a close correspondence with him. A warrant, meanwhile, was issued for seizing Ballard; and this incident, joined to the consciousness of guilt, begat in all the conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern. Some advised that they should immediately make their escape; others proposed that Savage and Charnoc should without delay execute their purpose against Elizabeth; and Babington, in prosecution of this scheme, furnished Savage with money, that he might buy good clothes, and thereby have more easy access to the queen's person. Next day, they began to apprehend that they had taken the alarm too hastily; and Babington, having renewed his correspondence with Walsingham, was persuaded by that subtle minister, that the seizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the usual diligence of informers in the detection of popish and seminary priests. He even consented to take lodgings secretly in Walsingham's house, that they might have more frequent conferences together before his intended departure for France; but observing that he was watched and guarded, he made his escape, and gave the alarm to the other conspirators. They all took to flight, covered themselves with several disguises, and lay concealed in woods or barns; but were soon discovered and thrown into prison. In their examinations they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to make a full confession of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and executed, of whom seven, acknowledged the crime on their trial; the rest were convicted by evidence.

The lesser conspirators being despatched, measures were taken for the trial and conviction of the queen of Scots; on whose account, and with whose concurrence, these attempts had been made against the life of the queen, and the tranquillity of the kingdom. Some of Elizabeth's counsellors were averse to this procedure, and thought that the close confinement of a woman who was become very sickly, and who would probably put a speedy period to their anxiety by her natural death, might give sufficient security to the government without attempting a measure of which there scarcely remains any example in history. Leicester advised that Mary should be secretly despatched by poison; and he sent a divine to convince Walsingham of the lawfulness of that action: but Walsingham declared his abhorrence of it; and still insisted, in conjunction with the majority of the counsellors, for the open trial of the queen of Scots. The situation of England, and of the English ministers, had, indeed, been hitherto not a little dangerous. No successor of the crown was declared; but the heir of blood, to whom the people in general were likely to adhere, was, by education, an enemy to the national religion; was, from multiplied provocations, an enemy to the ministers and principal nobility; and their personal safety, as well as the safety of the public, seemed to depend alone on the queen's life, who was now somewhat advanced in years. No wonder, therefore, that Elizabeth's counsellors, knowing themselves to be so obnoxious to the queen of Scots, endeavored to push every measure to extremities against her; and were even more anxious than the queen herself, to prevent her from ever mounting the throne of England.

Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington's conspiracy, every avenue to the queen of Scots had been so strictly guarded, that she remained in utter ignorance of the matter; and it was a great surprise to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges, by Elizabeth's orders, informed her, that all her accomplices were discovered and arrested. He chose the time for giving her this intelligence when she was mounted on horseback to go a hunting; and she was not permitted to return to her former place of abode, but war conducted from one gentleman's house to another, till she was lodged in Fotheringay Castle, in the County of Northampton, which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial and sufferings. Her two secretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a Scot, were immediately arrested: all her papers were seized, and sent up to the council: above sixty different keys to ciphers were discovered: there were also found many letters from persons beyond sea, and several too from English noblemen containing expressions of respect and attachment. The queen took no notice of this latter discovery; but the persons themselves, knowing their correspondence to be detected, though that they had no other means of making atonement for their imprudence, than by declaring themselves thenceforth the most inveterate enemies of the queen of Scots.[*]

       &nbsp* Camden, p. 518.

It was resolved to try Mary, not by the common statute of treasons, but by the act which had passed the former year with a view to this very event; and the queen, in terms of that act, appointed a commission, consisting of forty noblemen and privy counsellors, and empowered them to examine and pass sentence on Mary, whom she denominated the late queen of Scots, and heir to James V. of Scotland. The commissioners came to Fotheringay Castle, and sent to her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker, who delivered her a letter from Elizabeth, informing her of the commission, and of the approaching trial. Mary received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment. She said, however, that it seemed strange to her, that the queen should command her, as a subject, to submit to a trial and examination before subjects; that she was an absolute, independent princess, and would yield to nothing which might derogate either from her royal majesty, from the state of sovereign princes, or from the dignity and rank of her son: that, however oppressed by misfortunes, she was not yet so much broken in spirit as her enemies flattered themselves; nor would she, on any account, be accessary to her own degradation and dishonor: that she was ignorant of the laws and statutes of England; was utterly destitute of counsel; and could not conceive who were entitled to be called her peers, or could legally sit as judges on her trial: that though she had lived in England for many years, she had lived in captivity; and not having received the protection of the laws, she could not, merely by her involuntary residence in the country, be supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction: that, notwithstanding the superiority of her rank, she was willing to give an account of her conduct before an English parliament; but could not view these commissioners in any other light than as men appointed to justify, by some color of legal proceeding, her condemnation and execution: and that she warned them to look to their conscience and their character in trying an innocent person; and to reflect, that these transactions would somewhere be subject to revisal, and that the theatre of the whole world was much wider than the kingdom of England.

In return, the commissioners sent a new deputation, informing her, that her plea, either from her royal dignity or from her imprisonment, could not be admitted; and that they were empowered to proceed to her trial, even though she should refuse to answer before them. Burleigh, the treasurer, and Bromley, the chancellor, employed much reasoning to make her submit; but the person whose arguments had the chief influence, was Sir Christopher Hatton, vice-chamberlain. His speech was to this purpose: ""You are accused, madam,"" said he, ""but not condemned, of having conspired the destruction of our lady and queen anointed. You say you are a queen; but, in such a crime as this, and such a situation as yours, the royal dignity itself, neither by the civil or canon law, nor by the law of nature or of nations, is exempt from judgment. If you be innocent, you wrong your reputation in avoiding a trial. We have been present at your protestations of innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwise, and is heartily sorry for the appearances which lie against you. To examine, therefore, your cause, she has appointed commissioners; honorable persons, prudent and upright men, who are ready to hear you with equity, and even with favor, and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations which have been thrown upon you. Believe me, madam, the queen herself will rejoice, who affirmed to me, at my departure, that nothing which ever befell her had given her so much uneasiness, as that you should be suspected of a concurrence in these criminal enterprises. Laying aside, therefore, the fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity, which can now avail you nothing, trust to the better defence of your innocence, make it appear in open trial, and leave not upon your memory that stain of infamy which must attend your obstinate silence on this occasion."" [*]

       &nbsp* Camden, p. 523.

By this artful speech, Mary was persuaded to answer before the court; and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial, and prevented those difficulties which the commissioners must have fallen into, had she persevered in maintaining so specious a plea as that of her sovereign and independent character. Her conduct in this particular must be regarded as the more imprudent; because formerly, when Elizabeth's commissioners pretended not to exercise any jurisdiction over her, and only entered into her cause by her own consent and approbation, she declined justifying herself, when her honor, which ought to have been dearer to her than life, seemed absolutely to require it.

On her first appearance before the commissioners, Mary, either sensible of her imprudence, or still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a trial, renewed her protestation against the authority of her judges: the chancellor answered her, by pleading the supreme authority of the English laws over every one who resided in England; and the commissioners accommodated matters, by ordering both her protestation and his answer to be recorded.

The lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the queen of Scots. They proved, by intercepted letters, that she had allowed Cardinal Allen and others to treat her as queen of England; and that she had kept a correspondence with Lord Paget and Charles Paget, in view of engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom. Mary seemed not anxious to clear herself from either of these imputations. She only said that she could not hinder others from using what style they pleased in writing to her; and that she might lawfully try every expedient for the recovery of her liberty.

An intercepted letter of hers to Mendoza was next produced; in which she promised to transfer to Philip her right to the kingdom of England, if her son should refuse to be converted to the Catholic faith; an event, she there said, of which there was no expectation while he remained in the hands of his Scottish subjects.[*]

       &nbsp* State Trials, vol. i. p 138.

Even this part of the charge she took no pains to deny, or rather she seemed to acknowledge it. She said that she had no kingdoms to dispose of; yet was it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own, and she was not accountable to any for her actions. She added, that she had formerly rejected that proposal from Spain; but now, since all her hopes in England were gone, she was fully determined not to refuse foreign assistance. There was also produced evidence to prove, that Allen and Parsons were at that very time negotiating, by her orders, at Rome, the conditions of transferring her English crown to the king of Spain, and of disinheriting her heretical son.[*] 21

It is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices against her son were at this time carried so far, that she had even entered into a conspiracy against him, had appointed Lord Claud Hamilton regent of Scotland, and had instigated her adherents to seize James's person, and deliver him into the hands of the pope, or the king of Spain; whence he was never to be delivered, but on condition of his becoming Catholic.[**] 24

The only part of the charge which Mary positively denied, was her concurrence in the design of assassinating Elizabeth. This article, indeed, was the most heavy, and the only one that could fully justify the queen in proceeding to extremities against her. In order to prove the accusation, there were produced the following evidence: copies taken in Secretary Walsingham's office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington, in which her approbation of the murder was clearly expressed; the evidence of her two secretaries, Nau and Curle, who had confessed, without being put to any torture, both that she received these letters from Babington, and that they had written the answers by her order; the confession of Babington, that he had written the letters and received the answers,[***] and the confession of Ballard and Savage, that Babington had showed them these letters of Mary, written in the cipher which had been settled between them.

       &nbsp*** State Trials, vol. i. p. 113.

It is evident, that this complication of evidence, though every circumstance corroborates the general conclusion, resolves itself finally into the testimony of the two secretaries, who alone were certainly acquainted with their mistress's concurrence in Babington's conspiracy, but who knew themselves exposed to all the rigors of imprisonment, torture, and death, if they refused to give any evidence which might be required of them. In the case of an ordinary criminal, this proof, with all its disadvantages, would be esteemed legal, and even satisfactory, if not opposed by some other circumstances which shake the credit of the witnesses: but on the present trial, where the absolute power of the prosecutor concurred with such important interests, and such a violent inclination to have the princess condemned, the testimony of two witnesses, even though men of character, ought to be supported by strong probabilities, in order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice. The proof against Mary, it must be confessed, is not destitute of this advantage; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for Babington's receiving an answer written in her name, and in the cipher concerted between them, without allowing that the matter had been communicated to that princess. Such is the light in which this matter appears, even after time has discovered every thing which could guide our judgment with regard to it: no wonder, therefore, that the queen of Scots, unassisted by counsel, and confounded by so extraordinary a trial, found herself incapable of making a satisfactory defence before the commissioners. Her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial: whatever force may be in that denial was much weakened by her positively affirming, that she never had had any correspondence of any kind with Babington; a fact, however, of which there remains not the least question.[*] 25 She asserted, that as Nau and Curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence against her ought not to be credited. She confessed, however, that Nau had been in the service of her uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been recommended to her by the king of France, as a man in whom she might safely confide. She also acknowledged Curle to be a very honest man, but simple and easily imposed on by Nau. If these two men had received any letters, or had written any answers, without her knowledge, the imputation, she said, could never lie on her. And she was the more inclined, she added, to entertain this suspicion against them, because Nau had, in other instances, been guilty of a like temerity, and had ventured to transact business in her name, without communicating the matter to her.[**] 26

       &nbsp** See note Z, at the end cf the volume.

The sole circumstance of her defence which to us may appear to have some force, was her requiring that Nau and Cure should be confronted with her, and her affirming that they never would to her face persist in their evidence. But that demand, however equitable, was not then supported by law in trials of high treason, and was often refused, even in other trials where the crown was prosecutor. The clause contained in an act of the thirteenth of the queen, was a novelty; that the species of treason there enumerated must be proved by two witnesses, confronted with the criminal. But Mary was not tried upon that act; and the ministers and crown lawyers of this reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the strict letter of the law, and the settled practice of the courts of justice, required of them. Not to mention, that these secretaries were not probably at Fotheringay Castle during the time of the trial, and could not, upon Mary's demand, be produced before the commissioners.[*]

       &nbsp* Queen Elizabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau
       &nbspto be produced in the trial, and writes to that purpose to
       &nbspBurleigh and Walsingham, in her letter of the seventh of
       &nbspOctober, in Forbes's MS collections. She only says, that she
       &nbspthinks it needless, though she was willing to agree to it.
       &nbspThe not confronting of the witnesses was not the result of
       &nbspdesign, but the practice of the age.

There passed two incidents in this trial which may be worth observing. A letter between Mary and Babington was read, in which mention was made of the earl of Arundel and his brothers: on hearing their names, she broke into a sigh. ""Alas,"" said she, ""what has the noble house of the Howards suffered for my sake!"" She affirmed, with regard to the same letter, that it was easy to forge the handwriting and cipher of another; she was afraid that this was too familiar a practice with Walsingham, who, she also heard, had frequently practised both against her life and her son's. Walsingham, who was one of the commissioners, rose up. He protested that, in his private capacity, he had never acted any thing against the queen of Scots: in his public capacity, he owned, that his concern for his sovereign's safety had made him very diligent in searching out, by every expedient, all designs against her sacred person or her authority. For attaining that end, he would not only make use of the assistance of Ballard or any other conspirator; he would also reward them for betraying their companions. But if he had tampered in any manner unbefitting his character and office, why did none of the late criminals, either at their trial or execution accuse him of such practices? Mary endeavored to pacify him, by saying that she spoke from information; and she begged him to give thenceforth no more credit to such as slandered her, than she should to such as accused him. The great character, indeed, which Sir Francis Walsingham bears for probity and honor, should remove from him all suspicion of such base arts as forgery and subornation; arts which even the most corrupt ministers, in the most corrupt times, would scruple to employ.
Having finished the trial, the commissioners, adjourned from Fotheringay Castle, and met in the star chamber at London, where, after taking the oaths of Mary's two secretaries, who voluntarily, without hope or reward, vouched the authenticity of those letters before produced, they pronounced sentence of death upon the queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their seals and subscriptions. The same day, a declaration was published by the commissioners and the judges ""that the sentence did nowise derogate from the title and honor of James, king of Scotland; but that he was in the same place, degree, and right, as if the sentence had never been pronounced.""[*]

       &nbsp* Camden, p. 526.

The queen had now brought affairs with Mary to that situation which she had long ardently desired; and had found a plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor, whom, from the beginning of her reign, she had ever equally dreaded and hated. But she was restrained from instantly gratifying her resentment, by several important considerations. She foresaw the invidious colors in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partisans of Mary, and the reproach to which she herself might be exposed with all foreign princes, perhaps with all posterity. The rights of hospitality, of kindred, and of royal majesty, seemed in one signal instance to be all violated; and this sacrifice of generosity to interest, of clemency to revenge, might appear equally unbecoming a sovereign and a woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent hypocrite, pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed to the execution of the sentence; affected the most tender sympathy with her prisoner; displayed all her scruples and difficulties; rejected the solicitation of her courtiers and ministers; and affirmed that, were she not moved by the deepest concern for her people's safety, she would not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries which she herself had received from the queen of Scots.

That the voice of her people might be more audibly heard in the demand of justice upon Mary, she summoned a new parliament; and she knew, both from the usual dispositions of that assembly, and from the influence of her ministers over them, that she should not want the most earnest solicitation to consent to that measure which was so agreeable to her secret inclinations. She did not open this assembly in person, but appointed for that purpose three commissioners, Bromley, the chancellor, Burleigh, the treasurer, and the earl of Derby. The reason assigned for this measure was, that the queen, foreseeing that the affair of the queen of Scots would be canvassed in parliament, found her tenderness and delicacy so much hurt by that melancholy incident, that she had not the courage to be present while it was under deliberation, but withdrew her eyes from what she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and uneasiness. She was also willing, that, by this unusual precaution, the people should see the danger to which her person was hourly exposed; and should thence be more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal, whose restless intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her to the most imminent perils.[*]

The parliament answered the queen's expectations: the sentence against Mary was unanimously ratified by both houses, and an application was voted to obtain Elizabeth's consent to its publication and execution.[**] She gave an answer ambiguous, embarrassed; full of real artifice, and seeming irresolution. She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life was continually exposed; she declared her willingness to die, did she not foresee the great calamities which would thence fall upon the nation; she made professions of the greatest tenderness to her people; she displayed the clemency of her temper, and expressed her violent reluctance to execute the sentence against her unhappy kinswoman; she affirmed, that the late law, by which that princess was tried, so far from being made to insnare her, was only intended to give her warning beforehand, not to engage in such attempts as might expose her to the penalties with which she was thus openly menaced; and she begged them to think once again, whether it were possible to find any expedient, besides the death of the queen of Scots, for securing the public tranquility.[***]

The parliament, in obedience to her commands, took the affair again under consideration; but could find no other possible expedient. They reiterated their solicitations, and entreaties, and arguments: they even remonstrated, that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them, her subjects and children: and they affirmed, that it were injustice to deny execution of the law to any individual; much more to the whole body of the people, now unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her parental care and tenderness. This second address set the pretended doubts and scruples of Elizabeth anew in agitation; she complained of her now unfortunate situation; expressed her uneasiness from their importunity; renewed the professions of affection to her people; and dismissed the committee of parliament in an uncertainty what, after all this deliberation, might be her final resolution.[*] 27

But though the queen affected reluctance to execute the sentence against Mary, she complied with the request of parliament in publishing it by proclamation; and this act seemed to be attended with the unanimous and hearty rejoicings of the people. Lord Buckhurst, and Beale, clerk of the council, were sent to the queen of Scots, and notified to her the sentence pronounced against her, its ratification by parliament, and the earnest applications made for its execution by that assembly, who thought that their religion could never, while she was alive, attain a full settlement and security. Mary was nowise dismayed at this intelligence: on the contrary, she joyfully laid hold of the last circumstance mentioned to her; and insisted, that since her death was demanded by the Protestants for the establishment of their faith, she was really a martyr to her religion, and was entitled to all the merits attending that glorious character. She added, that the English had often imbrued their hands in the blood of their sovereigns: no wonder they exercised cruelty against her, who derived her descent from these monarchs.[**] Paulet, her keeper, received orders to take down her canopy, and to serve her no longer with the respect due to sovereign princes. He told her, that she was now to be considered as a dead person, and incapable of any dignity.[***] This harsh treatment produced not in her any seeming emotion. She only replied, that she received her royal character from the hands of the Almighty, and no earthly power was ever able to bereave her of it.

The queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Elizabeth; full of dignity, without departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity which appeared suitable to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life. She preferred no petition for averting the fatal sentence: on the contrary she expressed her gratitude to Heaven for thus bringing to a speedy period her sad and lamentable pilgrimage. She requested some favors of Elizabeth; and entreated her that she might be beholden for them to her own goodness alone, without making applications to those ministers who had discovered such an extreme malignity against her person and her religion. She desired, that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent blood, her body, which it was determined should never enjoy rest while her soul was united to it, might be consigned to her servants, and be conveyed by them into France, there to repose in a Catholic land, with the sacred relics of her mother. In Scotland, she said, the sepulchres of her ancestors were violated, and the churches either demolished or profaned; and in England, where she might be interred among the ancient kings, her own and Elizabeth's progenitors, she could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with those rites and ceremonies which her religion required. She requested, that no one might have the power of inflicting a private death upon her, without Elizabeth's knowledge; but that her execution should be public, and attended by her ancient servants, who might bear testimony of her perseverance in the faith, and of her submission to the will of Heaven. She begged that these servants might afterwards be allowed to depart whithersoever they pleased, and might enjoy those legacies which she should bequeath them. And she conjured her to grant these favors by their near kindred; by the soul and memory of Henry VII., the common ancestor of both; and by the royal dignity of which they equally participated.[*] Elizabeth made no answer to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refusal in her present situation, and foreseeing inconveniencies from granting some of her requests.

       &nbsp* Camden p. 529. Jebb, vol. ii. p. 295.

While the queen of Scots thus prepared herself to meet her fate, great efforts were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the execution of the sentence pronounced against her. Besides employing L'Aubespine, the French resident at London, a creature of the house of Guise, Henry sent over Bellièvre, with a professed intention of interceding for the life of Mary. The duke of Guise and the league at that time threatened very nearly the king's authority; and Elizabeth knew, that though that monarch might, from decency and policy, think himself obliged to interpose publicly in behalf of the queen of Scots, he could not secretly be much displeased with the death of a princess, on whose fortune and elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many daring and ambitious projects.[*] It is even pretended, that Bellievre had orders, after making public and vehement remonstrances against the execution of Mary, to exhort privately the queen, in his master's name, not to defer an act of justice so necessary for their common safety.[**] But whether the French king's intercession were sincere or not, it had no weight with the queen; and she still persisted in her former resolution.

The interposition of the young king of Scots, though not able to change Elizabeth's determination, seemed on every account to merit more regard. As soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his mother, he sent Sir William Keith, a gentleman of his bed-chamber, to London; and wrote a letter to the queen, in which he remonstrated in very severe terms against the indignity of the procedure. He said, that he was astonished to hear of the presumption of English noblemen and counsellors, who had dared to sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a queen of Scotland, descended from the blood royal of England; but he was still more astonished to hear, that thoughts were seriously entertained of putting that sentence in execution: that he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on the dishonor which she would draw on her name by imbruing her hands in the blood of her near kinswoman, a person of the same royal dignity and of the same sex with herself: that, in this unparalleled attempt, she offered an affront to all diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing sovereigns to a level with other men, taught the people to neglect all duty towards those whom Providence had appointed to rule over them: that for his part, he must deem the injury and insult so enormous, as to be incapable of all atonement; nor was it possible for him thenceforward to remain in any terms of correspondence with a person who, without any pretence of legal authority, had deliberately inflicted an ignominious death upon his parent: and that, even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not inspire him with this purpose of vengeance, his honor required it of him; nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world, if he did not use every effort, and endure every hazard, to revenge so great an indignity.[*]

Soon after, James sent the master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce the remonstrances of Keith, and to employ with the queen every expedient of argument and menaces. Elizabeth was at first offended with the sharpness of these applications; and she replied in a like strain to the Scottish ambassadors. When she afterwards reflected, that this earnestness was no more than what duty required of James, she was pacified; but still retained her resolution of executing the sentence against Mary.[**] It is believed, that the master of Gray, gained by the enemies of that princess, secretly gave his advice not to spare her, and undertook, in all events, to pacify his master.

       &nbsp** Spotswood, p. 353.

The queen also, from many considerations, was induced to pay small attention to the applications of James, and to disregard all the efforts which he could employ in behalf of his mother. She was well acquainted with his character and interests, the factions which prevailed among his people, and the inveterate hatred which the zealous Protestants, particularly the preachers, bore to the queen of Scots. The present incidents set these dispositions of the clergy in a full light. James, observing the fixed purpose of Elizabeth, ordered prayers to be offered up for Mary in all the churches; and knowing the captious humor of the ecclesiastics, he took care that the form of the petition should be most cautious, as well as humane and charitable: ""That it might please God to illuminate Mary with the light of his truth, and save her from the apparent danger with which she was threatened."" But, excepting the king's own chaplains, and one clergyman more, all the preachers refused to pollute their churches by prayers for a Papist, and would not so much as prefer a petition for her conversion. James, unwilling or unable to punish this disobedience, and desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault, appointed a new day when prayers should be said for his mother; and that he might at least secure himself from any insult in his own presence, he desired the archbishop of St. Andrews to officiate before him.

In order to disappoint this purpose, the clergy instigated one Couper, a young man who had not yet received holy orders, to take possession of the pulpit early in the morning, and to exclude the prelate. When the king came to church, and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he called to him from his seat, and told him, that the place was destined for another; yet since he was there, if he would obey the charge given, and remember the queen in his prayers, he might proceed to divine service. The preacher replied, that he would do as the Spirit of God should direct him. This answer sufficiently instructed James in his purpose; and he commanded him to leave the pulpit. As Couper seemed not disposed to obey, the captain of the guard went to pull him from his place; upon which the young man cried aloud, that this day would be a witness against the king in the great day of the Lord; and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for permitting him to be treated in that manner.[*] The audience at first appeared desirous to take part with him; but the sermon of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane disposition.

       &nbsp* Spotswood, p. 354.

Elizabeth, when solicited, either by James or by foreign princes, to pardon the queen of Scots, seemed always determined to execute the sentence against her: but when her ministers urged her to interpose no more delays, her scruples and her hesitation returned; her humanity could not allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary measures; and she was touched with compassion for the misfortunes, and with respect for the dignity, of the unhappy prisoner. The courtiers, sensible that they could do nothing more acceptable to her than to employ persuasion on this head, failed not to enforce every motive for the punishment of Mary, and to combat all the objections urged against this act of justice. They said, that the treatment of that princess in England had been, on her first reception, such as sound reason and policy required; and if she had been governed by principles of equity, she would not have refused willingly to acquiesce in it: that the obvious inconveniencies, either of allowing her to retire into France, or of restoring her by force to her throne, in opposition to the reformers and the English party in Scotland, had obliged the queen to detain her in England, till time should offer some opportunity of serving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to the Protestant religion that her usage there had been such as became her rank; her own servants, in considerable numbers, had been permitted to attend her, exercise had been allowed her for health, and all access of company for amusement; and these indulgences would, in time, have been carried further, if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of them: that after she had instigated the rebellion of Northumberland, the conspiracy of Norfolk, the bull of excommunication of Pope Pius, an invasion from Flanders; after she had seduced the queen's friends, and incited every enemy, foreign and domestic, against her; it became necessary to treat her as a most dangerous rival, and to render her confinement more strict and rigorous: that the queen, notwithstanding these repeated provocations, had, in her favor, rejected the importunity of her parliaments, and the advice of her sagest ministers;[*] and was still, in hopes of her amendment, determined to delay coming to the last extremities against her: that Mary, even in this forlorn condition, retained so high and unconquerable a spirit, that she acted as competitor to the crown, and allowed her partisans every where, and in their very letters addressed to herself, to treat her as queen of England: that she had carried her animosity so far as to encourage, in repeated instances, the atrocious design of assassinating the queen; and this crime was unquestionably proved upon her by her own letters, by the evidence of her secretaries, and by the dying confession of her accomplices; that she was but a titular queen, and at present possessed nowhere any right of sovereignty; much less in England, where, the moment she set foot in the kingdom, she voluntarily became subject to the laws, and to Elizabeth, the only true sovereign; that even allowing her to be still the queen's equal in rank and dignity, self-defence was permitted by a law of nature which could never be abrogated: and every one, still more a queen, had sufficient jurisdiction over an enemy, who, by open violence, and still more, who, by secret treachery, threatened the utmost danger against her life; that the general combination of the Catholics to exterminate the Protestants was no longer a secret; and as the sole resource of the latter persecuted sect lay in Elizabeth, so the chief hope which the former entertained of final success consisted in the person and in the title of the queen of Scots; that this very circumstance brought matters to extremity between these princesses; and rendering the life of one the death of the other, pointed out to Elizabeth the path which either regard to self-preservation, or to the happiness of her people, should direct her to pursue: and that necessity, more powerful than policy, thus demanded of the queen that resolution which equity would authorize, and which duty prescribed.[**]

When Elizabeth thought that as many importunities had been used, and as much delay interposed, as decency required, she at last determined to carry the sentence into execution: but even in this final resolution she could not proceed without displaying a new scene of duplicity and artifice. In order to alarm the vulgar, rumors were previously dispersed, that the Spanish fleet was arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots had made an irruption into England; that the duke of Guise was landed in Sussex with a strong army; that the queen of Scots was escaped from prison, and had raised an army; that the northern counties had begun an insurrection; that there was a new conspiracy on foot to assassinate the queen, and set the city of London on fire; nay, that the queen was actually assassinated.[*] An attempt of this nature was even imputed to L'Aubespine, the French ambassador; and that minister was obliged to leave the kingdom. The queen, affecting to be in terror and perplexity, was observed to sit much alone, pensive and silent; and sometimes to mutter to herself half sentences, importing the difficulty and distress to which she was reduced.[**]

She at last called Davison, a man of parts, but easy to be imposed on, and who had lately for that very reason been made secretary, and she ordered him privately to draw a warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots; which, she afterwards said, she intended to keep by her, in case any attempt should be made for the deliverance of that princess. She signed the warrant; and then commanded Davison to carry it to the chancellor, in order to have the great seal appended to it. Next day she sent Killigrew to Davison, enjoining him to forbear, some time, executing her former orders; and when Davison came and told her that the warrant had already passed the great seal, she seemed to be somewhat moved, and blamed him for his precipitation. Davison, being in perplexity, acquainted the council with this whole transaction; and they endeavored to persuade him to send off Beale with the warrant: if the queen should be displeased, they promised to justify his conduct, and to take on themselves the whole blame of this measure.[*] The secretary, not sufficiently aware of their intention, complied with the advice; and the warrant was despatched to the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, and some others, ordering them to see the sentence executed upon the queen of Scots.

The two earls came to Fotheringay Castle, and being introduced to Mary, informed her of their commission, and desired her to prepare for death next morning at eight o'clock. She seemed nowise terrified, though somewhat surprised, with the intelligence. She said with a cheerful, and even a smiling countenance, that she did not think the queen, her sister, would have consented to her death, or have executed the sentence against a person not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of England. ""But as such is her will,"" said she, ""death, which puts an end to all my miseries, shall be to me most welcome; nor can I esteem that soul worthy the felicities of heaven, which cannot support the body under the horrors of the last passage to these blissful mansions.""[**] She then requested the two noblemen, that they would permit some of her servants, and particularly her confessor, to attend her; but they told her, that compliance with this last demand was contrary to their conscience; [***] and that Dr. Fletcher, dean of Peterborough, a man of great learning, should be present to instruct her in the principles of true religion. Her refusal to have any conference with this divine inflamed the zeal of the earl of Kent; and he bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of their religion; as, on the contrary, her life would have been the death of it. Mention being made of Babington, she constantly denied his conspiracy to have been at all known to her; and the revenge of her wrongs she resigned into the hands of the Almighty.

       &nbsp* It appears, by some letters published by Strype, vol. iii.
       &nbspbook ii c., that Elizabeth had not expressly communicated
       &nbspher intention to any of her ministers, not even to Burleigh:
       &nbspthey were such experienced courtiers, that they knew they
       &nbspcould not gratify her more than by serving her without
       &nbspwaiting till she desired them.

When the earls had left her, she ordered supper to be hastened, that she might have the more leisure after it to finish the few affairs which remained to her in this world, and to prepare for her passage to another. It was necessary for her, she said, to take some sustenance, lest a failure of her bodily strength should depress her spirits on the morrow, and lest her behavior should thereby betray a weakness unworthy of herself.[*] She supped sparingly, as her manner usually was; and her wonted cheerfulness did not even desert her on this occasion. She comforted her servants under the affliction which overwhelmed them, and which was too violent for them to conceal it from her. Turning to Burgoin, her physician, she asked him, whether he did not remark the great and invincible force of truth. ""They pretend,"" said she, ""that I must die, because I conspired against their queen's life: but the earl of Kent avowed, that there was no other cause of my death, than the apprehensions which, if I should live, they entertain for their religion. My constancy in the faith is my real crime: the rest is only a color, invented by interested and designing men."" Towards the end of supper, she called in all her servants, and drank to them: they pledged her, in order, on their knees; and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty: she deigned, in return, to ask their pardon for her offences towards them; and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewell, and exchange of mutual forgiveness.[**]

Mary's care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which employed her concern. She perused her will, in which she had provided for them by legacies: she ordered the inventory of her goods, clothes, and jewels to be brought her: and she wrote down the names of those to whom she bequeathed each particular: to some she distributed money with her own hands; and she adapted the recompense to their different degrees of rank and merit. She wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to the French king, and to her cousin the duke of Guise, whom she made the chief executor of her testament. At her wonted time, she went to bed; slept some hours; and, then rising, spent the rest of the night in prayer. Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion, she had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of Pope Pius; and she had reserved the use of it for this last period of her life. By this expedient she supplied, as much as she could, the want of a priest and confessor, who was refused her.[*]

       &nbsp* Jebb, vol. ii. p, 489.

Towards the morning, she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and velvet, the only one which she had reserved to herself. She told her maids, that she would willingly have left them this dress, rather than the plain garb which she wore the day before: but it was necessary for her to appear at the ensuing solemnity in a decent habit.

Thomas Andrews, sheriff of the county, entered the room, and informed her that the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the place of execution. She replied, that she was ready; and bidding adieu to her servants, she leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet's guards, because of an infirmity in her limbs; and she followed the sheriff with a serene and composed countenance. In passing through a hall adjoining to her chamber, she was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gentlemen of distinction. Here she also found Sir Andrew Melvil, her steward, who flung himself on his knees before her; and wringing his hands, cried aloud, ""Ah, madam! unhappy me! what man was ever before the messenger of such heavy tidings as I must carry, when I shall return to my native country, and shall report, that I saw my gracious queen and mistress beheaded in England?"" His tears prevented further speech; and Mary too felt herself moved, more from sympathy than affliction. ""Cease, my good servant,"" said she, ""cease to lament: thou hast cause rather to rejoice than to mourn: for now shalt thou see the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long-expected period and completion. Know,"" continued she, ""good servant, that all the world at best is vanity, and subject still to more sorrow than a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray thee carry this message from me, that I die a true woman to my religion, and unalterable in my affections to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive them that have long desired my end, and have thirsted for my blood as the hart panteth after the water brooks!"" ""O God,"" added she, ""thou art the author of truth, and truth itself; thou knowest the inmost recesses of my heart: thou knowest that I was ever desirous to preserve an entire union between Scotland and England, and to obviate the source of all these fatal discords. But recommend me, Melvil, to my son; and tell him, that notwithstanding all my distresses, I have done nothing prejudicial to the state and kingdom of Scotland."" After these words, reclining herself, with weeping eyes, and face bedewed with tears, she kissed him. ""And so,"" said she, ""good Melvil, farewell: once again, farewell, good Melvil; and grant the assistance of thy prayers to thy queen and mistress.""[*]

She next turned to the noblemen, who attended her, and made a petition in behalf of her servants, that they might be well treated, be allowed to enjoy the presents which she had made them, and be sent safely into their own country. Having received a favorable answer, she preferred another request, that they might be permitted to attend her at her death; ""in order,"" said she, ""that their eyes may behold, and their hearts bear witness, how patiently their queen and mistress can submit to her execution, and how constantly she perseveres in her attachment to her religion."" The earl of Kent opposed this desire, and told her that they would be apt, by their speeches and cries, to disturb both herself and the spectators: he was also apprehensive lest they should practise some superstition, not meet for him to suffer; such as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood: for that was the instance which he made use of. ""My lord,"" said the queen of Scots, ""I will give my word (although it be but dead) that they shall not incur any blame in any of the actions which you have named. But alas! poor souls! it would be a great consolation to them to bid their mistress farewell. And I hope,"" added she, ""that your mistress, being a maiden queen, would vouchsafe, in regard of womanhood, that I should have some of my own people about me at my death. I know that her majesty hath not given you any such strict command, but that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy, even though I were a woman of inferior rank to that which I bear."" Finding that the earl of Kent persisted still in his refusal, her mind, which had fortified itself against the terrors of death, was affected by this indignity, for which she was not prepared. ""I am cousin to your queen,"" cried she, ""and descended from the blood royal of Henry VII., and a married queen of France, and an anointed queen of Scotland."" The commissioners, perceiving how invidious their obstinacy would appear, conferred a little together, and agreed that she might carry a few of her servants along with her. She made choice of four men and two maid servants for that purpose.

She then passed into another hall, where was erected the scaffold, covered with black; and she saw, with an undismayed countenance, the executioners and all the preparations of death. The room was crowded with spectators; and no one was so steeled against all sentiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he reflected on her royal dignity, considered the surprising train of her misfortunes, beheld her mild but inflexible constancy, recalled her amiable accomplishments, or surveyed her beauties, which, though faded by years, and yet more by her afflictions, still discovered themselves in this fatal moment. Here the warrant for her execution was read to her; and during this ceremony she was silent, but showed, in her behavior, an indifference and unconcern, as if the business had nowise regarded her. Before the executioners performed their office, the dean of Peterborough stepped forth; and though the queen frequently told him that he needed not concern himself about her, that she was settled in the ancient Catholic and Roman religion, and that she meant to lay down her life in defence of that faith, he still thought it his duty to persist in his lectures and exhortations, and to endeavor her conversion. The terms which he employed were, under color of pious instructions, cruel insults on her unfortunate situation; and besides their own absurdity, may be regarded as the most mortifying indignities to which she had ever yet been exposed. He told her, that the queen of England had on this occasion shown a tender care of her; and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be inflicted on her, for her manifold trespasses, was determined to use every expedient for saving her soul from that destruction with which it was so nearly threatened: that she was now standing upon the brink of eternity, and had no other means of escaping endless perdition, than by repenting her former wickedness, by justifying the sentence pronounced against her, by acknowledging the queen's favors, and by exerting a true and lively faith in Christ Jesus: that the Scriptures were the only rule of doctrine, the merits of Christ the only means of salvation; and if she trusted in the inventions or devices of men, she must expect in an instant to fall into utter darkness, into a place where shall be weeping howling, and gnashing of teeth: that the and of death was upon her, the axe was laid to the root of the tree, the throne of the great Judge of heaven was erected, the book of her life was spread wide, and the particular sentence and judgment was ready to be pronounced upon her: and that it was now, during this important moment, in her choice, either to rise to the resurrection of life, and hear that joyful salutation, ""Come, ye blessed of my Father,"" or to share the resurrection of condemnation, replete with sorrow and anguish; and to suffer that dreadful denunciation, ""Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.""[*]

During this discourse, Mary could not sometimes forbear betraying her impatience, by interrupting the preacher; and the dean, finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture, at last bade her change her opinion, repent her of her former wickedness, and settle her faith upon this ground, that only in Christ Jesus could she hope to be saved. She answered, again and again, with great earnestness, ""Trouble not yourself any more about the matter; for I was born in this religion, I have lived in this religion, and in this religion I am resolved to die."" Even the two earls perceived that it was fruitless to harass her any further with theological disputes; and they ordered the dean to desist from his unseasonable exhortations, and to pray for her conversion. During the dean's prayer, she employed herself in private devotion from the office of the Virgin; and after he had finished, she pronounced aloud some petitions in English, for the afflicted church, for an end of her own troubles, for her son, and for Queen Elizabeth; and prayed God, that that princess might long prosper, and be employed in his service. The earl of Kent, observing that in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her for her attachment to that Popish trumpery, as he termed it; and he exhorted her to have Christ in her heart, not in her hand.[**] She replied, with presence of mind, that it was difficult to hold such an object in her hand without feeling her heart touched with some compunction.[***]

She now began, with the aid of her two women, to disrobe herself; and the executioner also lent his hand to assist them. She smiled, and said that she was not accustomed to undress herself before so large a company, nor to be served by such valets. Her servants, seeing her in this condition, ready to lay her head upon the block, burst into tears and lamentations: she turned about to them; put her finger upon her lips, as a sign of imposing silence upon them;[*] and having given them her blessing, desired them to pray for her.

       &nbsp* Jebb, p. 307, 492.

One of her maids, whom she had appointed for that purpose, covered her eyes with a handkerchief; she laid herself down without any sign of fear or trepidation, and her head was severed from her body at two strokes by the executioner. He instantly held it up to the spectators, streaming with blood, and agitated with the convulsions of death: the dean of Peterborough alone exclaimed, ""So perish all Queen Elizabeth's enemies:"" the earl of Kent alone replied, ""Amen:"" the attention of all the other spectators was fixed on the melancholy scene before them; and zeal and flattery alike gave place to present pity and admiration of the expiring princess.

Thus perished, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and nineteenth of her captivity in England, Mary, queen of Scots; a woman of great accomplishments both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but unfortunate in her life, and during one period very unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make her the most amiable of women; and the charms of her address and conversation aided the impression which her lovely figure made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet inclined to cheerfulness and society; of a lofty spirit, constant and even vehement in her purpose, yet polite, and gentle, and affable in her demeanor; she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable, without relinquishing those soft graces which compose the proper ornament of her sex. In order to form a just idea of her character, we must set aside one part of her conduct, while she abandoned herself to the guidance of a profligate man; and must consider these faults, whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes, as the result of an inexplicable, though not uncommon inconstancy in the human mind of the frailty of our nature, of the violence of passion, and of the influence which situations, and sometimes momentary incidents, have on persons whose principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and reflection. Enraged by the ungrateful conduct of her husband, seduced by the treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence, transported by the violence of her own temper, which never lay sufficiently under the guidance of discretion; she was betrayed into actions which may with some difficulty be accounted for, but which admit of no apology, nor even of alleviation. An enumeration of her qualities might carry the appearance of a panegyric; an account of her conduct must, in some parts, wear the aspect of severe satire and invective.

       &nbsp* Jebb, p. 307, 492.

Her numerous misfortunes, the solitude of her long and tedious captivity, and the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account of her religion, had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during her later years; and such were the prevalent spirit and principles of the age, that it is the less wonder, if her zeal, her resentment, and her interest uniting, induced her to give consent to a design which conspirators, actuated only by the first of these motives, had formed against the life of Elizabeth.

When the queen was informed of Mary's execution, she affected the utmost surprise and indignation. Her countenance changed; her speech faltered and failed her; for a long time, her sorrow was so deep that she could not express it, but stood fixed, like a statue, in silence and mute astonishment. After her grief was able to find vent, it burst out in loud wailings and lamentations; she put herself in deep mourning for this deplorable event; and she was seen perpetually bathed in tears, and surrounded only by her maids and women. None of her ministers or counsellors dared to approach her; or if any had such temerity, she chased them from her, with the most violent expressions of rage and resentment; they had all of them been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in putting to death her dear sister and kinswoman, contrary to her fixed purpose,[*] of which they were sufficiently apprised and acquainted.

No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room for reflection, than she wrote a letter of apology to the king of Scots, and sent it by Sir Robert Cary, son of Lord Hunsdon. She there told him, that she wished he knew but not felt, the unutterable grief which she experienced on account of that lamentable accident which, without her knowledge, much less concurrence, had happened in England: that as her pen trembled when she attempted to write it, she found herself obliged to commit the relation of it to the messenger her kinsman; who would likewise inform his majesty of every circumstance attending this dismal and unlooked-for misfortune: that she appealed to the supreme Judge of heaven and earth for her innocence; and was also so happy amidst her other afflictions, as to find, that many persons in her court could bear witness to her veracity in this protestation: that she abhorred dissimulation; deemed nothing more worthy of a prince than a sincere and open conduct; and could never surely be esteemed so base and poor-spirited as that, if she had really given orders for this fatal execution, she could on any consideration be induced to deny them: that, though sensible of the justice of the sentence pronounced against the unhappy prisoner, she determined from clemency never to carry it into execution; and could not but resent the temerity of those who on this occasion had disappointed her intention: and that as no one loved him more dearly than herself, or bore a more anxious concern for his welfare, she hoped that he would consider every one as his enemy who endeavored, on account of the present incident, to excite any animosity between them.[*]

In order the better to appease James, she committed Davison to prison, and ordered him to be tried in the star chamber for his misdemeanor. The secretary was confounded; and being sensible of the danger which must attend his entering into a contest with the queen, he expressed penitence for his error, and submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very counsellors whose persuasion had induced him to incur the guilt, and who had promised to countenance and protect him. He was condemned to imprisonment during the queen's pleasure, and to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds. He remained a long time in custody; and the fine, though it reduced him to beggary, was rigorously levied upon him. All the favor which he could obtain from the queen, was sending him small supplies from time to time, to keep him from perishing in necessity.[**]

He privately wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham, which contains many curious particulars. The French and Scotch ambassadors, he said, had been remonstrating with the queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately after their departure, she commanded him, of her own accord to deliver her the warrant for the execution of that princess. She signed it readily, and ordered it to be sealed with the great seal of England. She appeared in such good humour on the occasion, that she said to him in a jocular manner, ""Go, tell all this to Walsingham, who is now sick; though I fear he will die of sorrow when he hears of it."" She added, that though she had so long delayed the execution, lest she should seem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, she was all along sensible of the necessity of it. In the same conversation, she blamed Drury and Paulet that they had not before eased her of this trouble; and she expressed her desire that Walsingham would bring them to compliance in that particular. She was so bent on this purpose, that some time after she asked Davison whether any letter had come from Paulet with regard to the service expected of him. Davison showed her Paulet's letter, in which that gentleman positively refused to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of honor and justice. The queen fell into a passion, and accused Paulet as well as Drury of perjury; because, having taken the oath of association, in which they had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs, they had yet refused to lend their hand on this occasion. ""But others,"" she said, ""will be found less scrupulous."" Davison adds, that nothing but the consent and exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him to send off the warrant: he was well aware of his danger; and remembered that the queen, after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had endeavored, in a like manner, to throw the whole blame and odium of that action upon Lord Burleigh.[*]

Elizabeth's dissimulation was so gross, that it could deceive nobody who was not previously resolved to be blinded; but as James's concern for his mother was certainly more sincere and cordial, he discovered the highest resentment, and refused to admit Cary into his presence. He recalled his ambassadors from England, and seemed to breathe nothing but war and vengeance. The states of Scotland, being assembled, took part in his anger; and professed that they were ready to spend their lives and fortunes in revenge of his mother's death, and in defence of his title to the crown of England. Many of his nobility instigated him to take arms: Lord Sinclair, when the courtiers appeared in deep mourning, presented himself to the king arrayed in complete armor and said, that this was the proper mourning for the queen. The Catholics took the opportunity of exhorting James to make an alliance with the king of Spain, to lay immediate claim to the crown of England, and to prevent the ruin which, from his mother's example, he might conclude would certainly, if Elizabeth's power prevailed, overwhelm his person and his kingdom. The queen was sensible of the danger attending these counsels; and after allowing James some decent interval to vent his grief and anger, she employed her emissaries to pacify him, and to set before him every motive of hope or fear which might induce him to live in amity with her.
Walsingham wrote to Lord Thirlstone, James's secretary, a judicious letter to the same purpose. He said that he was much surprised to hear of the violent resolutions taken in Scotland, and of the passion discovered by a prince of so much judgment and temper as James: that a war, founded merely on the principle of revenge, and that, too, on account of an act of justice which necessity had extorted, would for ever be exposed to censure, and could not be excused by any principles of equity or reason: that if these views were deemed less momentous among princes, policy and interest ought certainly to be attended to; and these motives did still more evidently oppose all thoughts of a rupture with Elizabeth, and all revival of exploded claims to the English throne: that the inequality between the two kingdoms deprived James of any hopes of success, if he trusted merely to the force of his own state, and had no recourse to foreign powers for assistance: that the objections attending the introduction of succors from a more potent monarch, appeared so evident from all the transactions of history, that they could not escape a person of the king's extensive knowledge; but there were in the present case several peculiar circumstances, which ought forever to deter him from having recourse to so dangerous an expedient: that the French monarch, the ancient ally of Scotland, might willingly use the assistance of that kingdom against England, but would be displeased to see the union of these two kingdoms in the person of James; a union which would ever after exclude him from practising that policy, formerly so useful to the French, and so pernicious to the Scottish nation: that Henry, besides, infested with faction and domestic war, was not in a condition of supporting distant allies, much less would he expose himself to any hazard or expense, in order to aggrandize a near kinsman of the house of Guise, the most determined enemies of his repose and authority: that the extensive power and exorbitant ambition of the Spanish monarch rendered him a still more dangerous ally to Scotland; and as he evidently aspired to a universal monarchy in the west, and had in particular advanced some claims to England as if he were descended from the house of Lancaster, he was at the same time the common enemy of all princes who wished to maintain their independence, and the immediate rival and competitor of the king of Scots: that the queen by her own naval power and her alliance with the Hollanders, would probably intercept all succors which might be sent to James from abroad, and be enabled to decide the controversy in this island, with the superior forces of her own kingdom, opposed to those of Scotland: that if the king revived his mother's pretensions to the crown of England, he must also embrace her religion, by which alone they could be justified; and must thereby undergo the infamy of abandoning those principles in which he had been strictly educated; and to which he had hitherto religiously adhered: that as he would, by such an apostasy, totally alienate all the Protestants in Scotland and England, he could never gain the confidence of the Catholics, who would still entertain reasonable doubts of his sincerity: that by advancing a present claim to the crown, he forfeited the certain prospect of his succession; and revived that national animosity which the late peace and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extinguished: that the whole gentry and nobility of England had openly declared themselves for the execution of the queen of Scots; and if James showed such violent resentment against that act of justice, they would be obliged, for their own security, to prevent forever so implacable a prince from ruling over them: and that, however some persons might represent his honor as engaged to seek vengeance for the present affront and injury, the true honor of a prince consisted in wisdom, and moderation, and justice, not in following the dictates of blind passion, or in pursuing revenge at the expense of every motive and every interest.[*]

These considerations, joined to the peaceable, unambitious temper of the young prince, prevailed over his resentment, and he fell gradually into a good correspondence with the court of England. It is probable that the queen's chief object in her dissimulation with regard to the execution of Mary, was, that she might thereby afford James a decent pretence for renewing his amity with her, on which their mutual interests so much depended.

While Elizabeth insured tranquillity from the attempts of her nearest neighbor, she was not negligent of more distant dangers. Hearing that Philip, though he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries which he received from the English, was secretly preparing a great navy to attack her, she sent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet to intercept his supplies, to pillage his coast, and to destroy his shipping. Drake carried out four capital ships of the queen's, and twenty-six, great and small, with which the London merchants, in hopes of sharing in the plunder, had supplied him. Having learned from two Dutch ships which he met with in his passage, that a Spanish fleet, richly laden, was lying at Cadiz, ready to sail for Lisbon, the rendezvous of the intended armada, he bent his course to the former harbor, and boldly, as well as fortunately, made an attack on the enemy. He obliged six galleys, which made head against him, to take shelter under the forts: he burned about a hundred vessels laden with ammunition and naval stores; and he destroyed a great ship of the marquis of Santa Croce. Thence he set sail for Cape St. Vincent, and took by assault the castle situated on that promontory, with three other fortresses. He next insulted Lisbon; and finding that the merchants, who had engaged entirely in expectation of profit, were discontented at these military enterprises, he set sail for the Terceras, with an intention of lying in wait for a rich carrack, which was expected in those parts. He was so fortunate as to meet with his prize; and by this short expedition, in which the public bore so small a share, the adventurers were encouraged to attempt further enterprises, the English seamen learned to despise the great unwieldy ships of the enemy, the naval preparations of Spain were destroyed, the intended expedition against England was retarded a twelvemonth, and the queen thereby had leisure to take more secure measures against that formidable invasion.[*]

This year, Thomas Cavendish, a gentleman of Devonshire, who had dissipated a good estate by living at court, being resolved to repair his fortune at the expense of the Spaniards fitted out three ships at Plymouth one of a hundred and twenty tons, another of sixty, and a third of forty; and with these small vessels he ventured into the South Sea, and committed great depredations on the Spaniards. He took nineteen vessels, some of which were richly laden; and returning by the Cape of Good Hope, he came to London, and entered the river in a kind of triumph. His mariners and soldiers were clothed in silk, his sails were of damask, his topsail cloth of gold; and his prizes were esteemed the richest that ever had been brought into England.[*]

The land enterprises of the English were not, during this campaign, so advantageous or honorable to the nation. The important place of Deventer was intrusted by Leicester to William Stanley, with a garrison of twelve hundred English; and this gentleman, being a Catholic, was alarmed at the discovery of Babington's conspiracy, and became apprehensive lest every one of his religion should thenceforth be treated with distrust in England. He entered into a correspondence with the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for a sum of money, and engaged the whole garrison to desert with him to the Spanish service. Roland York, who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his example; and the Hollanders, formerly disgusted with Leicester, and suspicious of the English, broke out into loud complaints against the improvidence, if not the treachery, of his administration. Soon after, he himself arrived in the Low Countries; but his conduct was nowise calculated to give them satisfaction, or to remove the suspicions which they had entertained against him. The prince of Parma having besieged Sluys, Leicester attempted to relieve the place, first by sea, then by land; but failed in both enterprises; and as he ascribed his bad success to the ill behavior of the Hollanders, they were equally free in reflections upon his conduct. The breach between them became wider every day: they slighted his authority, opposed his measures, and neglected his counsels; while he endeavored by an imperious behavior, and by violence, to recover that influence which he had lost by his imprudent and ill-concerted measures. He was even suspected by the Dutch of a design to usurp upon their liberties; and the jealousy entertained against him began to extend towards the queen herself. That princess had made some advances towards a peace with Spain: a congress had been opened at Bourbourg, a village near Graveline: and though the two courts, especially that of Spain, had no other intention than to amuse each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mutually relax the preparations for defence or attack, the Dutch, who were determined on no terms to return under the Spanish yoke, became apprehensive lest their liberty should be sacrificed to the political interests of England.[*] But the queen, who knew the importance of her alliance with the states during the present conjuncture, was resolved to give them entire satisfaction, by recalling Leicester, and commanding him to resign his government. Maurice son of the late prince of Orange, a youth of twenty years of age, was elected by the states governor in his place; and Peregrine Lord Willoughby was appointed by the queen commander of the English forces. The measures of these two generals were much embarrassed by the malignity of Leicester, who had left a faction behind him, and who still attempted, by means of his emissaries, to disturb all the operations of the states. As soon as Elizabeth received intelligence of these disorders, she took care to redress them; and she obliged all the partisans of England to fall into unanimity with Prince Maurice.[**] But though her good sense so far prevailed over her partiality to Leicester, she never could be made fully sensible of his vices and incapacity: the submissions which he made her restored him to her wonted favor; and Lord Buckhurst, who had accused him of misconduct in Holland, lost her confidence for some time, and was even committed to custody.

Sir Christopher Hatton was another favorite who at this time received some marks of her partiality. Though he had never followed the profession of the law, he was made chancellor, in the place of Bromley, deceased; but, notwithstanding all the expectations, and perhaps wishes of the lawyers, he behaved in a manner not unworthy of that high station: his good natural capacity supplied the place of experience and study; and his decisions were not found deficient, either in point of equity or judgment. His enemies had contributed to this promotion, in hopes that his absence from court, while he attended the business of chancery, would gradually estrange the queen from him, and give them an opportunity of undermining him in her favor.

1568.

These little intrigues and cabals of the court were silenced by the account which came from all quarters, of the vast preparations made by the Spaniards for the invasion of England, and for the entire conquest of that kingdom. Philip, though he had not yet declared war on account of the hostilities which Elizabeth every where committed upon him, had long harbored a secret and violent desire of revenge against her. His ambition also, and the hopes of extending his empire, were much encouraged by the present prosperous state of his affairs; by the conquest of Portugal, the acquisition of the East Indian commerce and settlements, and the yearly importation of vast treasures from America. The point on which he rested, his highest glory, the perpetual object of his policy, was to support orthodoxy and exterminate heresy; and as the power and credit of Elizabeth were the chief bulwark of the Protestants, he hoped, if he could subdue that princess, to acquire the eternal renown of reuniting the whole Christian world in the Catholic communion. Above all, his indignation against his revolted subjects in the Netherlands instigated him to attack the English, who had encouraged that insurrection; and who, by their vicinity, were so well enabled to support the Hollanders, that he could never hope to reduce these rebels, while the power of that kingdom remained entire and unbroken. To subdue England seemed a necessary preparative to the reestablishment of his authority in the Netherlands; and notwithstanding appearances, the former was in itself, as a more important, so a more easy undertaking than the latter. That kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries, and was more exposed to invasions from that quarter; after an enemy had once obtained entrance, the difficulty seemed to be over, as it was neither fortified by an or nature; a long peace had deprived it of all military discipline and experience; and the Catholics, in which it still abounded, would be ready, it was hoped, to join any invader who should free them from those persecutions under which they labored, and should revenge the death of the queen of Scots, on whom they had fixed all their affections. The fate of England must be decided in one battle at sea, and another at land; and what comparison between the English and Spaniards, either in point of naval force, or in the numbers, reputation, and veteran bravery of their armies? Besides the acquisition of so great a kingdom, success against England insured the immediate subjection of the Hollanders, who, attacked on every hand, and deprived of all support, must yield their stubborn necks to that yoke which they had so long resisted. Happily, this conquest, as it was of the utmost importance to the grandeur of Spain, would not at present be opposed by the jealousy of other powers, naturally so much interested to prevent the success of the enterprise. A truce was lately concluded with the Turks; the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally; and France, the perpetual rival of Spain, was so torn with intestine commotions, that she had no leisure to pay attention to her foreign interests. This favorable opportunity, therefore, which might never again present itself, must be seized; and one bold effort made for acquiring that ascendant in Europe, to which the present greatness and prosperity of the Spaniards seemed so fully to entitle them.[*]

These hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwithstanding his cautious temper, to undertake this hazardous enterprise; and though the prince, now created by the pope duke of Parma, when consulted, opposed the attempt, at least represented the necessity of previously getting possession of some seaport town in the Netherlands, which might afford a retreat to the Spanish navy,[**] it was determined by the Catholic monarch to proceed immediately to the execution of his ambitious project.

During some time, he had been secretly making preparations, out as soon as the resolution was fully taken, every part of his vast empire resounded with the noise of armaments, and all his ministers, generals, and admirals were employed in forwarding the design. The marquis of Santa Croce, a sea officer of great reputation and experience, was destined to command the fleet; and by his counsels were the naval equipments conducted. In all the ports of Sicily, Naples, Spain, and Portugal, artisans were employed in building vessels of uncommon size and force; naval stores were bought at a great expense; provisions amassed; armies levied and quartered in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for fitting out such a fleet and embarkation as had never before had its equal in Europe. The military preparations in Flanders were no less formidable. Troops from all quarters were every moment assembling to reënforce the duke of Parma. Capizuchi and Spinelli conducted forces from Italy: the marquis of Borgaut, a prince of the house of Austria, levied troops in Germany; the Walloon and Burgundian regiments were completed or augmented: the Spanish infantry was supplied with recruits and an army of thirty-four thousand men was assembled in the Netherlands, and kept in readiness to be transported into England. The duke of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he could procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Germany and the coasts of the Baltic; and he built at Dunkirk and Newport, but especially at Antwerp, a great number of boats and flat-bottomed vessels, for the transporting of his infantry and cavalry. The most renowned nobility and princes of Italy and Spain were ambitious of sharing in the honor of this great enterprise. Don Amadseus of Savoy, Don John of Medicis, Vespasian Gonzaga, duke of Sabionetta, and the duke of Pastrana, hastened to join the army under the duke of Parma. About two thousand volunteers in Spain, many of them men of family, had enlisted in the service. No doubts were entertained but such vast preparations, conducted by officers of such consummate skill, must finally be successful. And the Spaniards, ostentatious of their power, and elated with vain hopes, had already denominated their navy the Invincible Armada.

News of these extraordinary preparations soon reached the court of London; and notwithstanding the secrecy of the Spanish council, and their pretending to employ this force in the Indies, it was easily concluded that they meant to make some effort against England. The queen had foreseen the invasion; and finding that she must now contend for her crown with the whole force of Spain, she made preparations for resistance; nor was she dismayed with that power, by which all Europe apprehended she must of necessity be overwhelmed. Her force, indeed, seemed very unequal to resist so potent an enemy. All the sailors in England amounted at that time to about fourteen thousand men.[*] The size of the English shipping was in general so small, that except a few of the queen's ships of war, there were not four vessels belonging to the merchants which exceeded four hundred tons.[**] The royal navy consisted of only twenty-eight sail,[***] many of which were of small size; none of them exceeded the bulk of our largest frigates, and most of them deserved rather the name of pinnaces than of ships.

The only advantage of the English fleet consisted in the dexterity and courage of the seamen, who, being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas and expose themselves to all dangers, as much exceeded in this particular the Spanish mariners, as their vessels were inferior in size and force to those of that nation.[*] All the commercial towns of England were required to furnish ships for reenforcing this small navy; and they discovered, on the present occasion, great alacrity in defending their liberty and religion against those imminent perils with which they were menaced. The citizens of London, in order to show their zeal in the common cause, instead of fifteen vessels, which they were commanded to equip, voluntarily fitted out double the number.[**] The gentry and nobility hired, and armed, and manned forty-three ships at their own charge;[***] and all the loans of money which the queen demanded were frankly granted by the persons applied to. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of courage and capacity, was admiral, and took on him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe, served under him. The principal fleet was stationed at Plymouth. A smaller squadron, consisting of forty vessels, English and Flemish, was commanded by Lord Seymour, second son of Protector Somerset; and lay off Dunkirk, in order to intercept the duke of Parma.

The land forces of England, compared to those of Spain, possessed contrary qualities to its naval power: they were more numerous than the enemy, but much inferior in discipline, reputation, and experience. An army of twenty thousand men was disposed in different bodies along the south coast; and orders were given them, if they could not prevent the landing of the Spaniards, to retire backwards, to waste the country around, and to wait for reenforcement from the neighboring counties, before they approached the enemy. A body of twenty-two thousand foot and a thousand horse, under the command of the earl of Leicester, was stationed at Tilbury in order to defend the capital. The principal army consisted of thirty-four thousand foot and two thousand horse, and was commanded by Lord Hunsdon. These forces were reserved for guarding the queen's person, and were appointed to march whithersoever the enemy should appear. The fate of England, if all the Spanish armies should be able to land, seemed to depend on the issue of a single battle; and men of reflection entertained the most dismal apprehensions, when they considered the force of fifty thousand veteran Spaniards, commanded by experienced officers, under the duke of Parma, the most consummate general of the age; and compared this formidable armament with the military power which England, not enervated by peace, but long disused to war, could muster up against it.

The chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in the vigor and prudence of the queen's conduct; who, undismayed by the present dangers, issued all her orders with tranquillity, animated her people to a steady resistance, and employed every resource which either her domestic situation or her foreign alliances could afford her. She sent Sir Robert Sidney into Scotland; and exhorted the king to remain attached to her, and to consider the danger which at present menaced his sovereignty no less than her own, from the ambition of the Spanish tyrant:[*] the ambassador found James well disposed to cultivate a union with England; and that prince even kept himself prepared to march with the force of his whole kingdom to the assistance of Elizabeth. Her authority with the king of Denmark, and the tie of their common religion, engaged this monarch, upon her application, to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had bought or hired in the Danish harbors:[**] the Hanse Towns, though not at that time on good terms with Elizabeth, were induced, by the same motives, to retard so long the equipment of some vessels in their ports, that they became useless to the purpose of invading England. All the Protestants throughout Europe regarded this enterprise as the critical event which was to decide forever the fate of their religion; and though unable, by reason of their distance, to join their force to that of Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune, and beheld with anxiety, mixed with admiration, the intrepid countenance with which she encountered that dreadful tempest which was every moment advancing towards her.

The queen also was sensible that, next to the general popularity which she enjoyed, and the confidence which her subjects reposed in her prudent government, the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general zeal of the people for the Protestant religion, and the strong prejudices which they had imbibed against Popery. She took care, on the present occasion, to revive in the nation this attachment to their own sect, and this abhorrence of the opposite. The English were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain: all the barbarities exercised by Mary against the Protestants were ascribed to the counsels of that bigoted and imperious nation: the bloody massacres in the Indies, the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries, the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquisition, were set before men's eyes: a list and description was published, and pictures dispersed, of the several instruments of torture with which, it was pretended, the Spanish armada was loaded: and every artifice, as well as reason, was employed, to animate the people to a vigorous defence of their religion, their laws, and their liberties.

But while the queen, in this critical emergence, roused the animosity of the nation against Popery, she treated the partisans of that sect with moderation, and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them. Though she knew that Sixtus Quintus, the present pope, famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated a new bull of excommunication against her, had deposed her, had absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance, had published a crusade against England, and had granted plenary indulgences to every one engaged in the present invasion, she would not believe that all her Catholic subjects could be so blinded as to sacrifice to bigotry their duty to their sovereign, and the liberty and independence of their native country. She rejected all violent counsels, by which she was urged to seek pretences for despatching the leaders of that party: she would not even confine any considerable number of them: and the Catholics, sensible of this good usage, generally expressed great zeal for the public service. Some gentlemen of that sect, conscious that they could not justly expect any trust or authority, entered themselves as volunteers in the fleet or army:[*] some equipped ships at their own charge, and gave the command of them to Protestants: others were active in animating their tenants, and vassals, and neighbors, to the defence of their country: and every rank of men, burying for the present all party distinctions, seemed to prepare themselves, with order as well as vigor, to resist the violence of these invaders.

       &nbsp* Stowe, p. 747.

The more to excite the martial spirit of the nation, the queen appeared on horseback in the camp at Tilbury; and riding through the lines, discovered a cheerful and animated countenance, exhorted the soldiers to remember their duty to their country and their religion, and professed her intention, though a woman, to lead them herself into the field against the enemy, and rather to perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of her people.[*] 28

       &nbsp* See note BB, at the end of the volume.

By this spirited behavior she revived the tenderness and admiration of the soldiery: an attachment to her person became a kind of enthusiasm among them: and they asked one another, whether it were possible that Englishmen could abandon this glorious cause, could display less fortitude than appeared in the female sex, or could ever, by any dangers, be induced to relinquish the defence of their heroic princess.

The Spanish armada was ready in the beginning of May; but the moment it was preparing to sail, the marquis of Santa Croce, the admiral, was seized with a fever, of which he soon after died. The vice-admiral, the duke of Paliano, by a strange concurrence of accidents, at the very same time suffered the same fate; and the king appointed for admiral the duke of Medina Sidonia, a nobleman of great family, but unexperienced in action, and entirely unacquainted with sea affairs. Alcarede was appointed vice-admiral. This misfortune, besides the loss of so great an officer as Santa Croce, retarded the sailing of the armada, and gave the English more time for their preparations to oppose them. At last the Spanish fleet, full of hopes and alacrity, set sail from Lisbon; but next day met with a violent tempest, which scattered the ships, sunk some of the smallest, and forced the rest to take shelter in the Groine, where they waited till they could be refitted. When news of this event was carried to England, the queen concluded that the design of an invasion was disappointed for this summer; and being always ready to lay hold on every pretence for saving money, she made Walsingham write to the admiral, directing him to lay up some of the larger ships, and to discharge the seamen: but Lord Effingham, who was not so sanguine in his hopes, used the freedom to disobey these orders; and he begged leave to retain all the ships in service, though it should be at his own expense.[*] He took advantage of a north wind, and sailed towards the coast of Spain, with an intention of attacking the enemy in their harbors; but the wind changing to the south, he became apprehensive lest they might have set sail, and by passing him at sea, invade England, now exposed by the absence of the fleet. He returned, therefore, with the utmost expedition to Plymouth, and lay at anchor in that harbor.

Meanwhile all the damages of the armada were repaired; and the Spaniards with fresh hopes set out again to sea, in prosecution of their enterprise. The fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels, of which near a hundred were galleons, and were of greater size than any ever before used in Europe. It carried on board nineteen thousand two hundred and ninety-five soldiers, eight thousand four hundred and fifty-six mariners, two thousand and eighty-eight galley slaves, and two thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance. It was victualled for six months; and was attended by twenty lesser ships, called caravals, and ten salves with six oars apiece.[**]

The plan formed by the king of Spain was, that the armada should sail to the coast opposite to Dunkirk and Newport; and having chased away all English or Flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage, (for it was never supposed they could make opposition,) should join themselves with the duke of Parma, should thence make sail to the Thames, and having landed the whole Spanish army, thus complete at one blow the entire conquest of England. In prosecution of this scheme, Philip gave orders to the duke of Medina, that in passing along the Channel, he should sail as near the coast of France as he could with safety; that he should by this policy avoid meeting with the English fleet; and, keeping in view the main enterprise, should neglect all smaller successes which might prove an obstacle, or even interpose a delay, to the acquisition of a kingdom.[***]

After the armada was under sail, they took a fisherman, who informed them that the English admiral had been lately at sea, had heard of the tempest which scattered the armada, had retired back into Plymouth and no longer expecting an invasion this season, had laid up his ships, and discharged most of the seamen. From this false intelligence the duke of Medina conceived the great facility of attacking and destroying the English ships in harbor; and he was tempted, by the prospect of so decisive an advantage, to break his orders, and make sail directly for Plymouth; a resolution which proved the safety of England. The Lizard was the first land made by the armada, about sunset; and as the Spaniards took it for the Ram Head near Plymouth, they bore out to sea with an intention of returning next day, and attacking the English navy. They were descried by Fleming, a Scottish pirate, who was roving in those seas, and who immediately set sail, to inform the English admiral of their approach;[*] another fortunate event, which contributed extremely to the safety of the fleet. Effingham had just time to get out of port, when he saw the Spanish armada coming full sail towards him, disposed in the form of a crescent, and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one division to that of the other.

The writers of that age raise their style by a pompous description of this spectacle; the most magnificent that had ever appeared upon the ocean, infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders. The lofty masts, the swelling sails, and the towering prows of the Spanish galleons, seem impossible to be justly painted, but by assuming the colors of poetry; and an eloquent historian of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has asserted, that the armada, though the ships bore every sail, yet advanced with a slow motion; as if the ocean groaned with supporting, and the winds were tired with impelling, so enormous a weight.[**] The truth, however, is, that the largest of the Spanish vessels would scarcely pass for third-rates in the present navy of England; yet were they so ill framed, or so ill governed, that they were quite unwieldy, and could not sail upon a wind, nor tack on occasion, nor be managed in stormy weather by the seamen. Neither the mechanics of ship-building, nor the experience of mariners, had attained so great perfection as could serve for the security and government of such bulky vessels; and the English, who had already had experience how unserviceable they commonly were, beheld without dismay their tremendous appearance.

Effingham gave orders not to come to close fight with the Spaniards; where the size of the ships, he suspected, and the numbers of the soldiers, would be a disadvantage to the English; but to cannonade them at a distance, and to wait the opportunity which winds, currents, or various accidents must afford him of intercepting some scattered vessels of the enemy. Nor was it long before the event answered expectation A great ship of Biscay, on board of which was a considerable part of the Spanish money, took fire by accident; and while all hands were employed in extinguishing the flames, she fell behind the rest of the armada: the great galleon of Andalusia was detained by the springing of her mast: and both these vessels were taken, after some resistance, by Sir Francis Drake. As the armada advanced up the Channel, the English hung upon its rear, and still infested it with skirmishes. Each trial abated the confidence of the Spaniards, and added courage to the English; and the latter soon found, that even in close fight the size of the Spanish ships was no advantage to them. Their bulk exposed them the more to the fire of the enemy; while their cannon, placed too high, shot over the heads of the English. The alarm having now reached, the coast of England, the nobility and gentry hastened out, with their vessels from every harbor, and reënforced the admiral. The earls of Oxford, Northumberland, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vavasor, Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount, with many others, distinguished themselves by this generous and disinterested service of their country. The English fleet, after the conjunction of those ships, amounted to a hundred and forty sail.

The armada had now reached Calais, and cast anchor before that place, in expectation that the duke of Parma, who had gotten intelligence of their approach, would put to sea and join his forces to them. The English admiral practised here a successful stratagem upon the Spaniards. He took eight of his smaller ships, and filling them with all combustible materials, sent them, one after another, into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards fancied that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a famous vessel which had lately done so much execution in the Schelde near Antwerp; and they immediately cut their cables, and took to flight with the greatest disorder and precipitation. The English fell upon them next morning while in confusion; and besides doing great damage to other ships, they took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy.

By this time, it was become apparent, that the intention for which these preparations were made by the Spaniards was entirely frustrated. The vessels provided by the duke of Parma were made for transporting soldiers, not for fighting; and that general, when urged to leave the harbor, positively refused to expose his flourishing army to such apparent hazard; while the English not only were able to keep the sea, but seemed even to triumph over their enemy. The Spanish admiral found, in many rencounters, that while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy, he had destroyed only one small vessel of the English; and he foresaw, that by continuing so unequal a combat, he must draw inevitable destruction on all the remainder. He prepared, therefore, to return homewards; but as the wind was contrary to his passage through the Channel, he resolved to sail northwards, and making the tour of the island, reach the Spanish harbors by the ocean. The English fleet followed him during some time; and had not their ammunition fallen short, by the negligence of the offices in supplying them, they had obliged the whole armada to surrender at discretion. The duke of Medina had once taken that resolution, but was diverted from it by the advice of his confessor. This conclusion of the enterprise would have been more glorious to the English; but the event proved almost equally fatal to the Spaniards. A violent tempest overtook the armada after it passed the Orkneys; the ships had already lost their anchors, and were obliged to keep to sea: the mariners, unaccustomed to such hardships, and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels, yielded to the fury of the storm, and allowed their ships to drive either on the western isles of Scotland, or on the coast of Ireland, where they were miserably wrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to Spain; and the seamen as well as soldiers who remained, were so overcome with hardships and fatigue, and so dispirited by their discomfiture, that they filled all Spain with accounts of the desperate valor of the English and of the tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them.

Such was the miserable and dishonorable conclusion of an enterprise which had been preparing for three years, which had exhausted the revenue and force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety or expectation. Philip, who was a slave to his ambition, but had an entire command over his countenance, no sooner heard of the mortifying event which blasted all his hopes, than he fell on his knees, and rendering thanks for that gracious dispensation of Providence expressed his joy that the calamity was not greater. The Spanish priests, who had so often blessed this holy crusade and foretold its infallible success, were somewhat at a loss to account for the victory gained over the Catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable usurper: but they at last discovered, that all the calamities of the Spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among them.[*] 29

1589.

Soon after the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish armada, the queen summoned a new parliament, and received from them a supply of two subsidies and four fifteenths, payable in four years. This is the first instance that subsidies were doubled in one supply; and so unusual a concession was probably obtained from the joy of the present success, and from the general sense of the queen's necessities. Some members objected to this heavy charge, on account of the great burden of loans which had lately been imposed upon the nation.[**] 30

Elizabeth foresaw that this house of commons, like all the foregoing, would be governed by the Puritans; and therefore, to obviate their enterprises, she renewed, at the beginning of the session, her usual injunction, that the parliament should not on any account presume to treat of matters ecclesiastical. Notwithstanding this strict inhibition, the zeal of one Damport moved him to present a bill to the commons for remedying spiritual grievances, and for restraining the tyranny of the ecclesiastical commission, which were certainly great: but when Mr. Secretary Woley reminded the house of her majesty's commands, no one durst second the motion; the bill was not so much as read; and the speaker returned it to Damport without taking the least notice of it.[***] Some members of the house, notwithstanding the general submission were even committed to custody on account of this attempt.[****]

The imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still more clearly in another parliamentary transaction. The right of purveyance was an ancient prerogative, by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take provisions for the household from all the neighboring counties, and could make use of the carts and carriages of the farmers; and the price of these commodities and services was fixed and stated. The payment of the money was often distant and uncertain; and the rates, being fixed before the discovery of the West Indies, were much inferior to the present market price; so that purveyance, besides the slavery of it, was always regarded as a great burden, and being arbitrary and casual, was liable to great abuses. We may fairly presume, that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth, supported by her unlimited power, would be sure to render this prerogative very oppressive to the people; and the commons had, last session, found it necessary to pass a bill for regulating these exactions: but the bill was lost in the house of peers.[*] The continuance of the abuses begat a new attempt for redress; and the same bill was now revived, and again sent up to the house of peers, together with a bill for some new regulations in the court of exchequer. Soon after, the commons received a message from the upper house, desiring them to appoint a committee for a conference. At this conference, the peers informed them, that the queen, by a message delivered by Lord Burleigh, had expressed her displeasure that the commons should presume to touch on her prerogative. If there were any abuses, she said, either in imposing purveyance, or in the practice of the court of exchequer, her majesty was both able and willing to provide due reformation; but would not permit the parliament to intermeddle in these matters.[**]

The commons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed another committee to attend the queen, and endeavor to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful intentions. Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee: she expressed her great ""inestimable loving care"" towards her loving subjects; which, she said, was greater than of her own self, or even than any of them could have of themselves. She told them, that she had already given orders for an inquiry into the abuses attending purveyance, but the dangers of the Spanish invasion had retarded the progress of the design; that she had as much skill, will, and power to rule her household as any subjects whatsoever to govern theirs, and needed as little the assistance of her neighbors; that the exchequer was her chamber, consequently more near to her than even her house' bold, and therefore the less proper for them to intermeddle with; and that she would of herself, with advice of her council and the judges, redress every grievance in these matters, but would not permit the commons, by laws moved without her privity, to bereave her of the honor attending these regulations.[*] The issue of this matter was the same that attended all contests between Elizabeth and her parliaments.[**] She seems even to have been more imperious, in this particular, than her predecessors; at least her more remote ones: for they often permitted the abuses of purveyance[***] 31to be redressed by law.[****] Edward III., a very arbitrary prince, allowed ten several statutes to be enacted for that purpose.

In so great awe did the commons stand of every courtier, as well as of the crown, that they durst use no freedom of speech which they thought would give the least offence to any of them. Sir Edward Hobby showed in the house his extreme grief, that by some great personage, not a member of the house, he had been sharply rebuked for speeches delivered in parliament: he craved the favor of the house, and desired that some of the members might inform that great personage of his true meaning and intention in these speeches.[*] The commons, to obviate these inconveniencies, passed a vote that no one should reveal the secrets of the house.[**]

The discomfiture of the armada had begotten in the nation a kind of enthusiastic passion for enterprises against Spain; and nothing seemed now impossible to be achieved by the valor and fortune of the English. Don Antonio, prior of Crato, a natural son of the royal family of Portugal, trusting to the aversion of his countrymen against the Castilians, had advanced a claim to the crown; and flying first to France, thence to England, had been encouraged both by Henry and Elizabeth in his pretensions. A design was formed by the people, not the court of England, to conquer the kingdom for Don Antonio: Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris were the leaders in this romantic enterprise: near twenty thousand volunteers[*] enlisted themselves in the service: and ships were hired, as well as arms provided, at the charge of the adventurers. The queen's frugality kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand pounds to the expense; and she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the expedition.[**] There was more spirit and bravery than foresight or prudence in the conduct of this enterprise. The small stock of the adventurers did not enable them to buy either provisions or ammunition sufficient for such an undertaking; they even wanted vessels to stow the numerous volunteers who crowded to them; and they were obliged to seize by force some ships of the Hanse Towns, which they met with at sea; an expedient which set them somewhat at ease in point of room for their men, but remedied not the deficiency of their provisions.[***]

Had they sailed directly to Portugal, it is believed that the good will of the people, joined to the defenceless state of the country, might have insured them of success: but hearing that great preparations were making at the Groine for the invasion of England, they were induced to go thither, and destroy this new armament of Spain. They broke into the harbor; burned some ships of war, particularly one commanded by Recalde, vice-admiral of Spain; they defeated an army of four or five thousand men, which was assembled to oppose them; they assaulted the Groine, and took the lower town, which they pillaged; and they would have taken the higher, though well fortified, had they not found their ammunition and provisions beginning to fail them. The young earl of Essex, a nobleman of promising hopes, who, fired with the thirst of military honor, had secretly, unknown to the queen, stolen from England, here joined the adventurers; and it was then agreed by common consent to make sail for Portugal, the main object of their enterprise.

The English landed at Paniche, a seaport town twelve leagues from Lisbon, and Norris led the army to that capital, while Drake undertook to sail up the river, and attack the city with united forces. By this time, the court of Spain had gotten leisure to prepare against the invasion. Forces were thrown into Lisbon: the Portuguese were disarmed: all suspected persons were taken into custody: and thus, though the inhabitants bore great affection to Don Antonio, none of them durst declare in favor of the invaders. The English army, however, made themselves masters of the suburbs, which abounded with riches of all kinds; but as they desired to conciliate the affections of the Portuguese, and were more intent on honor than profit, they observed a strict discipline, and abstained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found their ammunition and provisions much exhausted; they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the walls; the admiral had not been able to pass some fortresses which guarded the river; there was no appearance of an insurrection in their favor; sickness, from fatigue, hunger, and intemperance in wine and fruits, had seized the army; so that it was found necessary to make all possible haste to reëmbark. They were not pursued by the enemy, and finding at the mouth of the river sixty ships laden with naval stores, they seized them as lawful prize; though they belonged to the Hanse Towns, a neutral power. They sailed thence to Vigo, which they took and burned; and having ravaged the country around, they set sail and arrived in England. Above half of these gallant adventurers perished by sickness, famine, fatigue, and the sword;[*] and England reaped more honor than profit from this extraordinary enterprise. It is computed, that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked on board the fleet, and that only three hundred and fifty survived those multiplied disasters.[**]

When these ships were on their voyage homewards, they met with the earl of Cumberland, who was outward bound, with a fleet of seven sail, all equipped at his own charge, except one ship of war which the queen had lent him. That nobleman supplied Sir Francis Drake with some provisions; a generosity which saved the lives of many of Drake's men, but for which the others afterwards suffered severely. Cumberland sailed towards the Terceras, and took several prizes from the enemy; but the richest, valued at a hundred thousand pounds, perished in her return, with all her cargo, near St. Michael's Mount, in Cornwall. Many of these adventurers were killed in a rash attempt at the Terceras: a great mortality seized the rest; and it was with difficulty that the few hands which remained were able to steer the ships back into harbor.[*]

Though the signal advantages gained over the Spaniards, and the spirit thence infused into the English, gave Elizabeth great security during the rest of her reign, she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye on Scotland, whose situation rendered its revolutions always of importance to her. It might have been expected that this high-spirited princess, who knew so well to brave danger, would not have retained that malignant jealousy towards her heir, with which, during the lifetime of Mary, she had been so much agitated. James had indeed succeeded to all the claims of his mother; but he had not succeeded to the favor of the Catholics, which could alone render these claims dangerous:[**] and as the queen was now well advanced in years, and enjoyed an uncontrolled authority over her subjects, it was not likely that the king of Scots, who was of an indolent, unambitious temper, would ever give her any disturbance in her possession of the throne. Yet all these circumstances could not remove her timorous suspicions; and so far from satisfying the nation by a settlement of the succession, or a declaration of James's title, she was as anxious to prevent every incident which might anywise raise his credit, or procure him the regard of the English, as if he had been her immediate rival and competitor. Most of his ministers and favorites were her pensioners; and as she was desirous to hinder him from marrying and having children, she obliged them to throw obstacles in the way of every alliance, even the most reasonable which could be offered him; and during some years she succeeded in this malignant policy.[***]

He had fixed on the elder daughter of the king of Denmark, who, being a remote prince and not powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did she so artfully cross this negotiation, that the Danish monarch, impatient of delay, married his daughter to the duke of Brunswick. James then renewed his suit to the younger princess, and still found obstacles from the intrigues of Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of interposing delay, proposed to him the sister of the king of Navarre, a princess much older than himself, and entirely destitute of fortune. The young king, besides the desire of securing himself, by the prospect of issue, from those traitorous attempts too frequent among his subjects had been so watched by the rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics, that he had another inducement to marry, which is not so usual with monarchs. His impatience, therefore, broke through all the politics of Elizabeth: the articles of marriage were settled; the ceremony was performed by proxy; and the princess embarked for Scotland; but was driven by a storm into a port of Norway. This tempest, and some others which happened near the same time, were universally believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded from a combination of the Scottish and Danish witches; and the dying confession of the criminals was supposed to put the accusation beyond all controversy.[*] James, however, though a great believer in sorcery, was not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage in order to conduct his bride home: he arrived in Norway; carried the queen thence to Copenhagen: and having passed the winter in that city, he brought her next spring to Scotland, where they were joyfully received by the people. The clergy alone, who never neglected an opportunity of vexing their prince, made opposition to the queen's coronation, on account of the ceremony of anointing her, which, they alleged, was either a Jewish or a Popish rite, and therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful. But James was as much bent on the ceremony as they were averse to it: and after much controversy and many intrigues, his authority, which had not often happened, at last prevailed over their opposition.[**]

20 : [ NOTE T, p. 216. Mary's extreme animosity against Elizabeth may easily be conceived, and it broke out about this tune in an incident which may appear curious. While the former queen was kept in custody by the earl of Shrewsbury, she lived during a long time in great intimacy with the countess; but that lady entertaining a jealousy of an amour between her and the earl, their friendship was converted into enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which at once gratified her spite against the countess and that against Elizabeth. She wrote to the queen, informing her of all the malicious, scandalous stories which, she said, the countess of Shrewsbury had reported of her: that Elizabeth had given a promise of marriage to a certain person, whom she afterwards often admitted to her bed: that she had been equally indulgent to Simier, the French agent, and to the duke of Anjou: that Hatton was also one of her paramours, who was even disgusted with her excessive love and fondness: that though she was on other occasions avaricious to the last degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, she spared no expense in gratifying her amorous passions: that notwithstanding her licentious amours, she was not made like other women; and all those who courted her in marriage would in the end be disappointed; that she was so conceited of her beauty, as to swallow the most extravagant flattery from her courtiers, who could not, on these occasions, forbear even sneering at her for her folly: that it was usual for them to tell her that the lustre of Her beauty dazzled them like that of the sun, and they could not behold it with a fixed eye. She added that the countess had said, that Mary's best policy would be to engage her son to make love to the queen; nor was there any danger that such a proposal would be taken for mockery; so ridiculous was the opinion which she had entertained of her own charms. She pretended that the countess had represented her as no less odious in her temper than profligate in her manners, and absurd in her vanity: that she had so beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore, as to break that lady's finger; and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended that the accident had proceeded from the fall of a candlestick: that she had cut another across the hand with a knife, who had been so unfortunate as to offend her. Mary added, that the countess had informed her, that Elizabeth had suborned Rolstone to pretend friendship to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby throw infamy on her rival. See Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was written a very little before the detection of Mary's conspiracy; and contributed, no doubt, to render the proceedings against her the more rigorous. How far all these imputations against Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear doubtful; but her extreme fondness for Leicester, Hatton, and Essex, not to mention Mountjoy and others, with the curious passages between her and Admiral Seymour, contained in Haynes, render her chastity very much to be suspected. Her self-conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other undoubted authority to have been extravagant. Even when she was a very old woman, she allowed her courtiers to flatter her with regard to her ""excellent beauties."" Birch, vol. ii. p. 442, 443. Her passionate temper may also be proved from many lively instances; and it was not unusual with her to beat her maids of honor. See the Sidney Papers, vol. ii. p. 38. The blow she gave to Essex before the privy council is another instance. There remains in the Museum a letter of the earl of Huntingdon's, in which he complains grievously of the queen's pinching his wife very sorely, on account of some quarrel between them. Had this princess been born in a private station, she would not have been very amiable; but her absolute authority, at the same time that it gave an uncontrolling swing to her violent passions, enabled her to compensate her infirmities by many great and signal virtues.]

21 :[ NOTE U, p. 226. Camden, p. 525. This evidence was that of Curie, her secretary, whom she allowed to be a very honest man; and who, as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by keeping so long such important secrets, from whose discovery he could have reaped the greatest profit. Mary, after all, thought that she had so little reason to complain of Curie's evidence, that she took care to have him paid a considerable sum by her will, which she wrote the day before her death. Goodall, vol. i. p. 413. Neither did she forget Nau, though less satisfied in other respects with his conduct. Id. ibid.]

24 :[ NOTE X, p. 226. The detail of this conspiracy is to be found in a letter of the queen of Scots to Charles Paget, her great confidant. This letter is dated the 20th of May, 1586, and is contained in Dr. Forbes's manuscript collections, at present in the possession of Lord Royston. It is a copy attested by Curie, Mary's secretary, and endorsed by Lord Burleigh. What proves its authenticity beyond question is, that we find in Murden's Collection, (p. 516,) that Mary actually wrote that very day a letter to Charles Paget; and further she mentions, in the manuscript letter, a letter of Charles Paget's of the 10th of April. Now we find by Murden, (p. 506,) that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date.

This violence of spirit is very consistent with Mary's character. Her maternal affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of her passions, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry. Her son, having made some fruitless attempts to associate her with him in the title, and having found the scheme impracticable on account of the prejudices of his Protestant subjects, at last desisted from that design and entered into an alliance with England, without comprehending his mother. She was in such a rage at this undutiful behavior, as she imagined it, that she wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that she no longer cared what became of him or herself in the world; the greatest satisfaction she could have before her death, was, to see him and all his adherents become a signal example of tyranny, ingratitude and impiety, and undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedness. She would find in Christendom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in such hands as would retain the firmest hold of it. She cared not, after taking this revenge, what became of her body. The quickest death would then be the most agreeable to her. And she assured her that, if he persevered, she would disown him for her son, would give him her malediction, would disinherit him, as well of his present possessions as of all he could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her subjects to treat him as they had done her, but to all strangers to subdue and conquer him. It was in vain to employ menaces against her: the fear of death or other misfortune would never induce her to make one step or pronounce one syllable beyond what she had determined. She would rather perish with honor, in maintaining the dignity to which God had raised her, than degrade herself by the least pusillanimity, or act what was unworthy of her station and of her race. Murden, p. 566, 567.

James said to Courcelles, the French ambassador, that he had seen a letter under her own hand, in which she threatened to disinherit him, and said that he might betake him to the lordship of Darnley; for that was all he had by his father. Courcelles' Letter, a MS. of Dr. Campbell's. There is in Jebb (vol. ii. p. 573) a letter of hers, where she throws out the same menace against him.

We find this scheme of seizing the king of Scots, and delivering him into the hands of the pope or the king of Spain, proposed by Morgan to Mary. See Murden, p. 525. A mother must be very violent to whom one would dare to make such a proposal; but it seems she assented to it. Was not such a woman very capable of murdering her husband, who had so grievously offended her?]

25 :[ NOTE Y, p. 227. The volume of state papers collected by Murden, prove, beyond controversy, that Mary was long in close correspondence with Babington, (p. 513, 516, 532, 533.) She entertained a like correspondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget, and laid a scheme with them for an insurrection, and for the invasion of England by Spain (p. 528,531.) The same papers show, that there had been a discontinuance of Babington's correspondence, agreeably to Camden's narration. See Slate Papers, (p. 513,) where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to renew her correspondence with Babington. These circumstances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's denial of guilt, and that her correspondence with Babington contained particulars which could not be avowed.]

26 :[ NOTE Z, p. 227. There are three suppositions by which the letter to Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth. The first is, that which she seems herself to have embraced, that her secretaries had received Babington's letter, and had, without any treacherous intention, ventured of themselves to answer it, and had never communicated the matter to her. But it is utterly improbable, if not impossible, that a princess of so much sense and spirit should, in an affair of that importance, be so treated by her servants who lived in the house with her, and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the secret to her. If the conspiracy failed, they must expect to suffer the severest punishment from the court of England; if it succeeded, the lightest punishment which they could hope for from their own mistress, must be disgrace, on account of their temerity. Not to mention, that Mary's concurrence was in some degree requisite for effecting the design of her escape. It was proposed to attack her guards while she was employed in hunting; she must therefore concert the time and place with the conspirators. The second supposition is, that these two secretaries were previously traitors; and being gained by Walsingham, had made such a reply in their mistress's cipher, as might involve her in the guilt of the conspiracy. But these two men had lived long with the queen of Scots, had been entirely trusted by her, and had never fallen under suspicion either with her or her partisans. Camden informs us, that Curle afterwards claimed a reward from Walsingham, on pretence of some promise; but Walsingham told him that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no discoveries on his examination which were not known with certainty from other quarters. The third supposition is, that neither the queen nor the two secretaries, Nau and Curle, ever saw Babington's letter, or made any answer; but that Walsingham, having deciphered the former, forged a reply. But this supposition implies the falsehood of the whole story, told by Camden, of Gifford's access to the queen of Scots' family, and Paulet's refusal to concur in allowing his servants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's and Curle's evidence must, on this supposition, have been extorted by violence and terror, they would necessarily have been engaged, for their own justification, to have told the truth afterwards; especially upon the accession of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event, persisted still in his testimony.

We must also consider, that the two last suppositions imply such a monstrous criminal conduct in Walsingham, and consequently in Elizabeth, (for the matter could be no secret to her,) as exceeds all credibility. If we consider the situation of things, and the prejudices of the times, Mary's consent to Babington's conspiracy appears much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be a usurper and a heretic. She regarded her as a personal and a violent enemy. She knew that schemes for assassinating heretics were very familiar in that age, and generally approved of by the court of Rome and the zealous Catholics. Her own liberty and sovereignty were connected with the success of this enterprise; and it cannot appear strange, that where men of so much merit as Babington could be engaged by bigotry alone in so criminal an enterprise, Mary, who was actuated by the same motive, joined to so many others, should have given her consent to a scheme projected by her friends. We may be previously certain, that if such a scheme was ever communicated to her, with any probability of success, she would assent to it; and it served the purpose of Walsingham and the English ministry to facilitate the communication of these schemes, as soon as they had gotten an expedient for intercepting her answer, and detecting the conspiracy. Now, Walsingham's knowledge of the matter is a supposition necessary to account for the letter delivered to Babington.

As to the not punishing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it never is the practice to punish lesser criminals, who had given evidence against the principal.

But what ought to induce us to reject these three suppositions is, that they must all of them be considered as bare possibilities. The partisans of Mary can give no reason for preferring one to the other. Not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any one of them. Neither at that time, nor at any time afterwards, was any reason discovered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief of any of these three suppositions; and even her apologists at present seem not to have fixed on any choice among these supposed possibilities. The positive proof of two very credible witnesses, supported by the other very strong circumstances, still remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an extreme interest to have communication with the queen of Scots, believed he had found a means of correspondence with her, and had received an answer from her. He, as well as the other conspirators, died in that belief. There has not occurred, since that time, the least argument to prove that they were mistaken; can there be any reason at present to doubt the truth of their opinion? Camden, though a professed apologist for Mary, is constrained to tell the story in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt. Such was the impossibility of finding any other consistent account, even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!

In this light might the question have appeared even during Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controversy is the following passage of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July, 1586: ""As to Babington, he hath both kindly and honestly offered himself and all his means to be employed any way I would; whereupon I hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters since I had his; and the rather for that I opened him the way, thereby I received his with your aforesaid."" Murden, p. 533. Babington confessed that he had offered her to assassinate the queen. It appears by this that she had accepted the offer; so that all the suppositions of Walsingham's forgery, or the temerity or treachery of her secretaries, fall to the ground.]

27 :[ NOTE AA, p 231 This parliament granted the queen a supply of a subsidy and two fifteenths. They adjourned, and met again after the execution of the queen of Scots; when there passed some remarkable incidents, which it may be proper not to omit. We shall give them in the words of Sir Simon D'Ewes, (p. 410, 411,) which are almost wholly transcribed from Townshend's Journal. On Monday, the 27th of February, Mr. Cope, first using some speeches touching the necessity of a learned ministry, and the amendment of things amiss in the ecclesiastical estate, offered to the house a bill and a book written; the bill containing a petition, that it might be enacted, that all laws now in force touching ecclesiastical government should be void; and that it might be enacted, that the Book of Common Prayer now offered, and none other, might be received into the church to be used. The book contained the form of prayer and administration of the sacraments, with divers rites and ceremonies to be used in the church; and he desired that the book might be read. Whereupon Mr. Speaker in effect used this speech: For that her majesty before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with this matter, and that her majesty had promised to take order in those causes, he doubted not but to the good satisfaction of all her people, he desired that it would please them to spare the reading of it. Notwithstanding the house desired the reading of it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker desired the clerk to read. And the court being ready to read it, Mr. Dalton made a motion against the reading of it, saying, that it was not meet to be read, and it did appoint a new form of administration of the sacraments and ceremonies of the church, to the discredit of the Book of Common Prayer and of the whole state; and thought that this dealing would bring her majesty's indignation against the house, thus to enterprise this dealing with those things which her majesty especially had taken into her own charge and direction. Whereupon Mr. Lewkenor spake, showing the necessity of preaching and of a learned ministry, and thought it very fit that the petition and book should be read. To this purpose spake Mr. Hurleston and Mr. Bainbrigg; and so, the time being passed, the house broke up, and neither the petition nor book read. This done, her majesty sent to Mr. Speaker, as well for this petition and book, as for that other petition and book for the like effect, that was delivered the last session of parliament, which Mr. Speaker sent to her majesty. On Tuesday, the 28th of February, her majesty sent for Mr. Speaker, by occasion whereof the house did not sit. On Wednesday, the first of March, Mr. Wentworth delivered to Mr. Speaker certain articles, which contained questions touching the liberties of the house, and to some of which he was to answer, and desired they might be read. Mr. Speaker desired him to spare his motion until her majesty's pleasure was further known touching the petition and book lately delivered into the house; but Mr. Wentworth would not be so satisfied, but required his articles might be read. Mr. Wentworth introduced his queries by lamenting that he, as well as many others, were deterred from speaking by their want of knowledge and experience in the liberties of the house; and the queries were as follows: Whether this council were not a place for any member of the same here assembled, freely and without controlment of any person or danger of laws, by bill or speech to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever, touching the service of God, the safety of the prince, and this noble realm? Whether that great honor may be done unto God, and benefit and service unto the prince and state, without free speech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there be any council which can make, add, or diminish from the laws of the realm, but only this council of parliament? Whether it be not against the orders of this council to make any secret or matter of weight, which is here in hand, known to the prince or any other, concerning the high service of God, prince, or state without the consent of the house? Whether the speaker or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his speech used in this house tending to any of the forenamed services? Whether the speaker may rise when he will, any matter being propounded, without consent of the house or not? Whether the speaker may overrule the house in any matter or cause there in question, or whether he is to be ruled or overruled in any matter or not? Whether the prince and state can continue, and stand, and be maintained, without this council of parliament, not altering the government of the state? At the end of these questions, says Sir Simon D'Ewes, I found set down this short memorial ensuing; by which it may be perceived both what Serjeant Puckering, the speaker, did with the said questions after he had received them, and what became also of this business, viz.: ""These questions Mr. Puckering pocketed up, and showed Sir Thomas Henage, who so handled the matter, that Mr. Wentworth went to the Tower, and the questions not at all moved. Mr. Buckler of Essex herein brake his faith in forsaking the matter, etc., and no more was done."" After setting down, continues Sir Simon D'Ewes, the said business of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows only this short conclusion of the day itself, viz.: ""This day, Mr. Speaker being sent for to the queen's majesty, the house departed."" On Thursday, the 2d of March, Mr. Cope, Mr. Lewkenor, Mr. Hurleston, and Mr. Bainbrigg were sent for to my lord chancellor and by divers of the privy council, and from thence were sent to the Tower. On Saturday the 4th day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this house, for that divers good and necessary members thereof were taken from them, that it would please them to be humble petitioners to her majesty for the restitution of them again to this house. To which speeches Mr. Vice-chamberlain answered, that if the gentlemen were committed for matter within the compass of the privilege of the house, then there might be a petition; but if not, then we should give occasion to her majesty's further displeasure; and therefore advised to stay until they heard more, which could not be long. And further, he said, touching the book and the petition, her majesty had, for divers good causes best known to herself, thought fit to suppress the same, without any further examination thereof; and yet thought it very unfit for her majesty to give any account of her doings. But whatsoever Mr. Vice-chamberlain pretended, it is most probable these members were committed for intermeddling with matters touching the church, which her majesty had often inhibited, and which had caused so much disputation and so many meetings between the two houses the last parliament.

This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D'Ewes and Townshend; and it appears that those members who had been committed, were detained in custody till the queen thought proper to release them. These questions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; because they contain some faint dawn of the present English constitution, though suddenly eclipsed by the arbitrary government of Elizabeth. Wentworth was indeed by his Puritanism, as well as his love of liberty, (for these two characters, of such unequal merit, arose and advanced together,) the true forerunner of the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Hollises, who in the next age, with less courage, because with less danger, rendered their principles so triumphant. I shall only ask, whether it be not sufficiently clear from all these transactions, that in the two succeeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign, not the sovereign who attempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon the people?]

28 :[ NOTE BB, p. 259. The queen's speech in the camp of Tilbury was in these words. ""My loving people, we have been persuaded, by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear: I have always so behaved myself that, under God, I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects. And therefore I am come amongst you at this time, not as for my recreation or sport, but being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honor and my blood; even in the dust. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart of a king, and of a king of England too; and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms; to which rather than any dishonor should grow by me, I myself will take up arms. I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. I know already, by your forwardness, that you have deserved rewards and crowns; and we do assure you, on the word of a prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the mean time, my lieutenant-general shall be in my stead; than whom never prince commanded a more noble and worthy subject; not doubting, by your obedience to my general, by your concord in the camp, and your valor in the field, we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my God, of my kingdom, and of my people.""]

29 :[ NOTE CC, p. 264. Strype, vol. iii. p. 525. On the 4th of September, boon after the dispersion of the Spanish armada, died the earl of Leicester, the queen's great but unworthy favorite. Her affection for him continued to the last. He had discovered no conduct in any of his military enterprises, and was suspected of cowardice; yet she intrusted him with the command of her armies during the danger of the Spanish invasion; a partiality which might have proved fatal to her, had the duke of Parma been able to land his troops in England. She had even ordered a commission to be drawn for him, constituting him her lieutenant, in the kingdoms of England and Ireland; but Burleigh and Hatton represented to her the danger of intrusting such unlimited authority in the hands of any subject, and prevented the execution of that design. No wonder that a conduct so unlike the usual jealousy of Elizabeth, gave reason to suspect that her partiality was founded on some other passion than friendship. But Elizabeth seemed to carry her affection to Leicester no farther than the grave; she ordered his goods to be disposed of at a public sale, in order to reimburse herself of some debt which he owed her; and her usual attention to money was observed to prevail over her regard to the memory of the deceased. This earl was a great hypocrite, a pretender to the strictest religion, an encourager of the Puritans, and founder of hospitals.]

30 :[ NOTE DD, p. 264. Strype, vol. iii. p. 542. Id. append, p. 239. There are some singular passages in this last speech, which may be worth taking notice of, especially as they came from a member who was no courtier; for he argues against the subsidy. ""And first,"" says he, ""for the necessity thereof, I cannot deny, but if it were a charge imposed upon us by her majesty's commandment, or a demand proceeding from her majesty by way of request, that I think there is not one among us all, either so disobedient a subject in regard of our duty, or so unthankful a man in respect of the inestimable benefits which by her or from her we have received, which would not with frank consent, both of voice and heart, most willingly submit himself thereunto, without any unreverend inquiry into the causes thereof. For it is continually in the mouth of us all, that our lands, goods, and lives, are at our prince's disposing. And it agreeth very well with that position of the civil law, which sayeth, 'Quod omnia regis aunt,' But how? 'Ita tamen ut omnium sint. Ad regem enim potestas omnium pertinet; ad singulos proprietas.' So that although it be most true that her majesty hath over ourselves and our goods 'potestatem imperandi,' yet it is true, that until that power command, (which, no doubt, will not command without very just cause,) every subject hath his own 'proprietatem possidendi.' Which power and commandment from her majesty, which we have not yet received, I take it, (saving reformation,) that we are freed from the cause of necessity. And the cause of necessity is the dangerous estate of the commonwealth,"" etc. The tenor of the speech pleads rather for a general benevolence than a subsidy; for the law of Richard III. against benevolence was nevei conceived to have any force. The member even proceeds to assert, with some precaution, that it was in the power of parliament to refuse the king's demand of a subsidy; and that there was an instance of that liberty in Heary III.'s time near four hundred years before. Sub Fine.]

31 :[ NOTE EE, p. 266 We may judge of the extent and importance of these abuses by a speech of Bacon's against purveyors, delivered in the first session of the first parliament of the subsequent reign, by which also we may learn that Elizabeth had given no redress to the grievances complained of. ""First,"" says he, ""they take in kind what they ought not to take; secondly, they take in quantity a far greater proportion than cometh to your majesty's use; thirdly, they take in an unlawful manner, in a manner, I say, directly and expressly prohibited by the several laws. For the first, I am a little to alter their name; for in stead of takers, they become taxers. Instead of taking provisions for your majesty's service, they tax your people 'ad redimendam vexationem;' imposing upon them and extorting from them divers sums of money, sometimes in gross, sometimes in the nature of stipends annually paid, 'ne noceant,' to be freed and eased of their oppression Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber trees which are the beauty, countenance, and shelter of men's houses; that men have long spared from their own purse and profit; that men esteem for their use and delight, above ten times the value; that are a loss which men cannot repair or recover. These do they take, to the defacing and spoiling of your subjects' mansions and dwellings, except they may be compounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiff or a servant remaining, and put the axe to the root of the tree, ere even the master can stop it. Again, they use a strange and most unjust exaction in causing the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due from your majesty unto them; so as a poor man, when he has had his hay, or his wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had for the provision of his own family, and not to put to sale) taken from him, and that not at a just price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his money, he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for poundage of his due payment upon so hard conditions. Nay, further, they are grown to that extremity, (as is affirmed, though it be scarce credible, save that in such persons all things are credible,) that they will take double poundage once when the debenture is made, and again the second time when the money is paid. For the second point, most gracious sovereign, touching the quantity which they take far above that which is answered to your majesty's use; it is affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may safely avouch unto your majesty, that there is no pound profit which redoundeth unto your majesty in this course, but induceth and begetteth three pound damage upon your subjects, beside the discontentment. And to the end they may make their spoil more securely, what do they? Whereas divers statutes do strictly provide, that whatsoever they take shall De registered and attested, to the end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country and that which is answered above, their deceits might appear, they, to the end, to obscure their deceits, utterly omit the observation of this, which the law prescribeth. And therefore to descend, if it may please your majesty, to the third sort of abuse, which is of the unlawful manner of their taking, whereof this question is a branch; it is so manifold, as it rather asketh an enumeration of some of the particulars than a prosecution of all. For their price, by law they ought to take as they can agree with the subject; by abuse, they take at an imposed and enforced price. By law they ought to take but one apprizement by neighbors in the country; by abuse, they make a second apprizement at the court gate; and when the subjects' cattle come up many miles, lean and out of plight by reason of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated price. By law, they ought to take between sun and sun; by abuse, they take by twilight and in the night time, a time well chosen for malefactors. By law, they ought not to take in the highways, (a place by her majesty's high prerogative protected, and by statute by special words excepted;) by abuse, they take in the highways. By law, they ought to show their commission, etc. A number of other particulars there are,"" etc. Bacon's Works, vol. iv. p. 305, 306.

Such were the abuses which Elizabeth would neither permit her parliaments to meddle with, nor redress herself. I believe it will readily be allowed, that this slight prerogative alone, which has passed almost unobserved amidst other branches of so much greater importance, was sufficient to extinguish all regular liberty. For what elector, or member of parliament, or even juryman, durst oppose the will of the court, while he lay under the lash of such an arbitrary prerogative? For a further account of the grievous and incredible oppressions of purveyors, see the Journals of the house of commons, vol. i. p. 190. There is a story of a carter, which may be worth mentioning on this occasion. ""A carter had three times been at Windsor with his cart, to carry away, upon summons of a remove, some part of the stuff of her majesty's wardrobe; and when he had repaired thither once, twice, and the third time, and that they of the wardrobe had told him the third time, that the remove held not, the carter, slapping his hand on his thigh, said, 'Now I see that the queen is a woman as well as my wife;' which words being overheard by her majesty, who then stood at the window, she said, 'What a villain is this?' and so sent him three angels to stop his mouth."" Birch's Memoirs, vol. i. p. 155.]

It was Della and the Dealer and a dog named Jake and a cat named Kalamazoo
Left the city in a pickup truck gonna make some dreams come true
Yeah they rolled out west where the wild sun sets and the coyote bays at the moon
Della and the Dealer and a dog named Jake and a cat named Kalamazoo

If that cat could talk what tales he'd tell
About Della and the Dealer and the dog as well
But the cat was cool and he never said a mumblin' word

Down Tucson way there's a small cafe where they play a little cowboy tune
And the guitar picker was a friend of mine by the name of Randy Boone
Yeah Randy played her a sweet love song and Della got a fire in her eyes
The Dealer had a knife and the dog had a gun and the cat had a shot of Rye

If that cat could talk...

Yeah the Dealer was a killer he was evil and mean
And he was jealous of the fire in her eyes
He snorted his coke through a century note and swore that Boone would die
And the stage was set when the lights went out there was death in Tucson town
Two shadows ran for the bar backdoor and one stayed on the ground

If that cat could talk...
If that cat could talk...

Two shadows ran from the bar that night and dog and cat ran too
And the tires got hot on the pickup truck as down the road they flew
It was Della and her lover and a dog named Jake and a cat named Kalamazoo
Left Tucson in a pickup truck gonna make some dreams come true

Yeah yeah yeah if that cat could talk...

937,Johnny Cash,49,(ghost)riders In The Sky,1979,"

[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went riding out
One dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
A Plowing through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy drawl

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-aie, Yippie-yi-oh!
The Ghost Riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-aie, Yippie-yi-oh!
The Ghost Riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught 'em yet
Because they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-aie, Yippie-yi-oh!
The Ghost Riders in the sky

[Verse 4]
As the riders loped on by him
As He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
From Riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies

Making money at thirty with a wife and a son
Then a short five years later it all comes undone
She's gone back to mama with the boy by her side

I'm on the backside of thirty and back on my own
An empty apartment don't feel like a home
On the backside of thirty, the short side of time
Back on the bottom with no will to climb

It's dawn Monday morning and I just called in sick
I skipped work last Friday to drink this much red
And when my friends ask me, Lord, I'll tell them I'm fine
But my eyes tell a story that my lies can't hide

I'm on the backside of thirty and back on my own
An empty apartment don't feel like a home
On the backside of thirty, the short side of time
Back on the bottom with no will to climb

We knew we had problems with no chance to win
Pretended we'd make it, does she have the kid?
And he made life better for two years or more
But now, weekends between us will be his reward

Her man was working those Friday nights and I was out here all alone
And I offered her a drink I guess she’s had a few
She showed me pictures of her family and I showed her mine too

And she said you’ve got somebody I’ve got somebody
What are we doing here
This scene was fun when we were single and young
Now we’re just fighting the fear
You got somebody I got somebody why can’t we go home
When you’re trying to prove you’ve still got what it takes
You’re afraid to walk out alone
You got somebody I got somebody why don’t we go home

I saw past her face and to the rest of the place
All the eyes were looking at me
Most of them thought she’d bought my lies gonna take her home with me
I wondered how many had someone trusting them while they were away
Only faces with something to hide and I felt like I wanted to say

You’ve got somebody I’ve got somebody

953,The Oak Ridge Boys,7,Trying To Love Two Women,1980,"

[Chorus]
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Trying to love two women is like a ball and chain
Sometimes the pleasure ain't worth the strain
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Verse 1]
Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
Trying to hold two women is tearing me apart
One's got my money, the other's got my heart
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Bridge]
When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
When you try to please two women, you can't please yourself
At best it's only half good; a man can't stock two shelves
It's a long old grind, and it tires your mind

[Chorus]

954,Dolly Parton,8,Starting Over Again,1980,"

[Verse 1]
Momma moved out, Daddy sold the house
They split up the money and went on their way
And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Mommy and Daddy back together again

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Where should they begin?
Because they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin?
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries

[Verse 2]
Got an apartment, she moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty odd years

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end

[Verse 3]
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk
It's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Breaking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Could never put Mommy and Daddy back together
Back together, again

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run aground like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
We got the kind of love to see us through

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

Found each others arms in troubled waters
Found that that's the safest place to go
From now on we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause the roughest storms just seem to make love grow

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth

956,Anne Murray,10,Lucky Me,1980,"

There must be thousands of people out there
Who search for love and find more than their share
They seem to fall into it naturally
But you know that doesn't apply to me

Some fools (some fools) get lucky
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
But some fools like me, they never learn
They keep on playin' the game
And it turns out the same
Oh, when will it ever be lucky me?

I got that butterfly feeling inside
With you I knew that love had fin'lly arrived
Now like all the rest you say goodbye
Leavin' me alone to keep wondering why

Some fools (some fools) get lucky
The first time out take a chance on love and they win
But some fools like me, they never learn
They keep on playin' the game
Though it turns out the same
Oh, when will it ever be
Oh my heart aches impatiently
Oh when will it ever be lucky me?

When will it ever be lucky me?

[Verse 1]
He said ""I'll love you til I die""
She told him ""you'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

[Verse 2]
He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

[Bridge]
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time - he's over her for good

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

Wish I was down on some blue bayou
With a bamboo cane stuck in the sand
But the road I'm on, don't seem to go there

Did what I do with a willing hand
Some would run, but that ain't like me
So I just dream and keep on being the way I am

[Verse 1: George Jones]
Well old Noah picked up a hammer and said
I need a [?] I go for wood
I'ma going to build myself an ark
'Cause there's going to be a flood
Well he worked and told everybody get ready
Or you're going to drown
And when he got it build he said ""hold up""
Before the rain comes a pouring down

[Chorus: George Jones & George Jones & Tammy Wynette]
He loaded two of a kind of everything that lived
On earth and then he closed the door
His wife went along and beared three sons
And their wives were all on board
Well the water destroyed everything on earth
Noah told the men he's not to blame
For 40 long days and nights it fell
And don't you know it was a mighty rain

[Verse 2: George Jones]
Well the water was deeper than the trees
And the web of the highest hill
They sailed along for days and days
Till at last the ark stood still
Then Noah opened up the wind the wives
And the dove could look about
He knew there was land when the dove returned
With an olive leaf in his mouth

[Chorus: George Jones & George Jones & Tammy Wynette]
He loaded two of a kind of everything that lived
On earth and then he closed the door
His wife went along and beared three sons
And their wives were all on board
Well the water destroyed everything on earth
Noah told the men he's not to blame
For 40 long days and nights it fell
And don't you know it was a mighty rain

He loaded two of a kind of everything that lived
On earth and then he closed the door
His wife went along and beared three sons
And their wives were all on board
Well the water destroyed everything on earth
Noah told the men he's not to blame
For 40 long days and nights it fell
And don't you know it was a mighty rain

Well don't you know it was a mighty rain
Don't you know it was a mighty rain
Well don't you know it was a mighty rain

966,Gene Watson,20,Bedroom Ballad,1980,"

Somehow two people brought their lives together
In a lasting kind of way
Somewhere between forever and right now
Is where I'll always stay
'Cause when she sings her songs of love
I see myself between her ever line
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Nobody seems to understand how any man can
Wear a smile all day
They ask me who was on the phone 'cause guys
Never talk to wives that way
She's got a way of sayin' things just when
I need a thought to make it rhyme
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Like, honey, I love you
And its it already seven
Just sayin' that she needs me
Takes me mighty close to Heaven
And she'll hug and chase me off to work
With a song of love that most men never find
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind
Her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

I met my old lover
On the street last night
He seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

Well, I'm not the kind
Who tends to socialise
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Wow, still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Worn out, Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I worry?
It's all gonna fade

You know I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy, yeah I'm crazy
Still crazy, Oh, I'm crazy
Still crazy after all these years

He's been working all week he's got mental fatigue and that old couch sure looks fine
All week he's been gone she's been sitting alone slowly going out of her mind
As he kicks off his shoes for the six o’clock news she's getting all prettied up
Oh she's wanting to boogie he's wanting to lay there she's got the Friday night blues

And the Friday night blues they get in your shoes and they work to get you down
Oh and there ain't a lady that I ever knew who didn't need her a night on the town
But the hills and the bills and a week's worth of deals has got him feeling more than used
Oh, he's kicking his shoes off she's putting hers on she's got the Friday night blues

Oh there once was a time she was top of the line her nights like teenage dreams
Now it's operas at noon, dancing round with her broom talking to the washing machine
Oh, the girl down the street says her old man is neat and she makes it sound so true
Now she's feeling lonely thinks she's the only one with the Friday night blues

And the Friday night blues they get in your shoes and they work to get you down
Oh and there ain't a lady that I ever knew who didn't need her a night on the town
But the hills and the bills and a week's worth of deals has got him feeling more than used
Oh, he's kicking his shoes off she's putting hers on she's got the Friday night blues

Oh those Friday night blues they get in your shoes and they work to get you down

I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again

Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again

I've never had any reason to doubt her as far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eye I wonder if she's seeing somebody new

You can't blame a body for looking when there's whole world of people out there
But I hope she's not taking any closer looks I tell you lately frankly I've been scared

Cause she just started liking...

I've got to admit I do some looking too but she's the only one I love
She still tells me she still loves me but I wonder if my love's enough

Cause she just started liking...
Yes she just started liking...

Well, I was born a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor
But we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mine
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn'

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way

In the summertime
We didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime
We'd all get a brand new pair from a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter

And sure could use a friend (I got Pesso to spend)
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again

Though I can tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kind of naked without it
And it eases the fear in my head

Just pass me the salt n'the lemon
Bend down n'blow out the light
I never had trusted the woman
But Sheila I'll trust you tonight

So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again..

Sheila I'm hearing your heart beat
But I'm hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawling with damn federalists
And Sheila there's no place to hide

I don't know who could have tipped them
Nobody knew but you
But I can't make love to a squealer, Sheila
So I guess there's just one thing to do

Pour me another Tequila Sheila
I'm gonna put on your red dress, you put on my cloths
You go out and face the dealer
And Sheila, I wish you the best

And I dream in the morning she brings me water
And I dream in the evening she brings me wine
Just a poor man's daughter from Puerta Pinasco Evangelina in old Mexico
There's a great hot desert south of Mexicali
If you don't have water boy you'd better not go
Tequila won't get you across that desert to Evangelina in old Mexico
And the fire I feel for the woman I love is drivin' me insane
Knowing she's waiting and I can't get there
God only knows that I wracked my brain to try and find the way
To reach that woman in old Mexico
( ac.guitar )
And I met a kind man he guarded the border
He said you don't need papers I'll let you go
I can tell that you love her by the look in your eyes now
She's the rose of the desert in old Mexico
And the fire I feel for the woman..

Diane if you're gonna do him wrong again
You might as well do the wrong again with me
I haven't told a soul nobody knows about you and me
Diane if you're gonna do him wrong again
You might as well do the wrong again with me

We both lost our heads in the red wine
Left the lounge and drove to another town
Spent the night in a ten dollar mansion
You woke me the next morning crying

You ask me to forget about the things we did
Said you had no cause to be with me
And I believed you loved him so I stayed away
Diane you're back again and you swore you wouldn't be

Repeat #1

Here we sit at the same corner table
Playing the same songs with our dimes
Talking the same old conversation
Losing our heads again in the red wine

Repeat #1

Hirsh-Melton

You had an invitation to ride shotgun in a parade tomorrow and I declined for you
You're a good girl
You know where the parade was ? It's out there in the shopper's park and then Santa and his two little elves Jingle and Jangle, and they've got a lot of these chocolate thin candies wrapped...
Bright suburban Mr. & Mrs. Clean Machine
Sucker children twisters on your TV screen
Look away, fill your heads with decay
Down trip news broadcast day
Find yourselves another piece of clay to play with
Simple Simon warriors fighting battles won
Christopher Columbus, you find your setting sun
By the way, your directions are wrong
And the words are too long
Tomorrow's just another song to play with
Take it, David!
Look away, fill your heads with decay
Down trip news broadcast day
Find yourselves another piece of clay to play with
Bubble bath parader in your parking lot
Stumbling over backward with the things you've got
Better pay, the price is so high
Stoned fast against the sky
I don't give you no lines to play with
Screaming pirate handing me a double line
Instructions painted plainly on a billboard sign
Walk away, your life you don't live
And your mind you must give to the people
Third floor: underwear, Barbie dolls, war toys, underarm deodorants, hair-spray, plastic artificial flowers, bubble bath powder

Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian
Standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Chocktaw maid
Over in the Georgia store
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no
And he always wore his Sunday feathers
And carried his old black hawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids
An hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
Cause his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian
Never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Chocktaw maid
Wearin' the long, black hair
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
Cause his heart was made of knotty pine
And then one day, a wealthy customer
Bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away
And ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?

Places faces jokers they play like they're aces kings and queens in shadowy scenes
Where the wine and the love are flowin'
And the lady you meet let you know she's goin' your way

When the sun sinks low and the working people go home
And the night life part of the city starts to turn on yeah

Counting the neon blow no one's alone

Climb back up the mountain by supper time

Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember

And save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancing under starlit skies
Please don't let stars get in your eyes
Just save your heart for me

When you're all alone
Far away from home
Someones gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong
If you play along
Just dont fall for someone new

When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again
I know
So save your heart for me

Please remember
I'm in love with you
So save your heart for me

When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up from another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road once again it seems
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you

And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you

But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh how I love you

Rain in the sky
A tear in my eye
Static on the radio
The long night's begun
With dinner for one
You said you'd never go

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak

Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again

Cold coffee cup
Sun coming up
Sleep is a distant dream
Something you said
Rolls round in my head
Something that you didn't mean

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak

Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak

[Verse 1]
You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking, ""who is this guy?""
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

[Chorus]
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

[Verse 2]
Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?
Splitting your dice to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

[Chorus]
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache

Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night

A-waiting in the front yard sitting on a log
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog
Yonder come my kinfolk, in the moonlight
Louisiana Saturday night

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night

My brother Bill and my other brother Jack
Belly full of beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light
Louisana Saturday night

When your kinfolk leave and the kids get fed
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor

[Chorus]
I wish I had of known you when you were a little younger, around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I'd known you longer you might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do, maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

[Verse 1]
As he walked into the poolroom you could tell he didn't fit
In his hand made boots, custom suit, pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around, The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady as the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a General on a battlefield of slate
And he would say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight, he'd say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now Billy Joe was busted but he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table he threw his Mother's wedding ring
And he said, You won my money but it isn't going to do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick
The Baron's eyes grew foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he was hit below the belt
Twenty years ago it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder, when the Baron shot the break
But it grew quickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished, the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hand that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said

[Chorus]

Whisper 'I need you' to her
Take her far from the crazy old crowd
Take her, love her
Where she's the only one allowed

Whisper 'I love you' to her
Make her feel like the woman she is
Soothe her, remember
A thousand words leavin' a kiss

Whisper to your woman once in a while
'Cause all the sweet, sweet nothing's
Whispered in her ear
Will make her smile

She may be liberated
She'll like your style
So whisper to your woman
Once in a while

Whisper to your woman
Take it from me
And when you need her love
She'll give herself to you so easily

She'll be tender
She'll surrender and then
It's time to whisper to your woman
Once again

Whisper 'I need you' to her
Take far from the crazy old crowd
Take her

Is it only because you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

There's no way that I'll let go

Never did see everything looking so right
I just learned the meaning of paradise

And the skies are a little bit bluer
And my little old rattletrap Ford Coupe
Even seems a little bit newer

And my guitar stays a little bit better in tune
The stars are brighter
There's honey on the moon
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Ever since you cuddled in my embrace
I've had more faith in the human race
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Now I don't mind working and slaving all day
Cause I know tonight
There'll be love to pay
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Everything seems natural and right
Since the day I found you
Everything looks rosy and shiny bright
In the dreams I'm building around you

I used to think that
Miracles never come true but now
I'm happy cause I know they do
It's a lovely, lovely world since I met you

Looks like I'll run out of highway before I out run the rain

But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
You'd leave a cold dark cloud, a raining down on me

And everything I left behind was waiting up ahead
Pulling on the bottom baby, looking back on you

She'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now
By now she's slipped into her night gown
She's letting down her soft brown hair
By now she needs someone to hold her
And I know she's wishing I was there

Who can say what comes tomorrow, what the future holds
What lies down the road, heaven only knows
But one thing I know for certain, one thing that's true
One thing I'm sure of is I need you

Surround me with love, I need you beside me

As he passes by the horns of death
And the crowd jumps to its feet to roar
For the Matador

With the scarlet cape against his hips
And ""Hey Toro"" whispered from his lips
And inside my heart is beating for
The Matador

Tonight we'll meet beneath the silver stars
Dance to mandolins and soft guitars
I dream I give my love once more
To the matador
To the matador

As I watch his body turn and twist
He doesn't know that I exist
Though I've shared so many dreams before
With the matador

Tonight we'll meet beneath the silver stars
Dance to mandolins and soft guitars
I dream I give my love once more
To the matador
To the matador

And as he leaves the ring they cheer
Sombreros fly into the air
And I throw the crimson rose I wore
To the matador

[Verse 1]
Whisper to me softly
Breathe words upon my skin
No one's near and listening
So please don't say goodbye

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Press your lips to mine
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

[Verse 2]
Lying here beside you
I hear the echoes of your sighs
Promise me you'll stay with me
And keep me warm tonight

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Give my heart a smile
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

[Verse 3]
Your body feels so gentle
And my passion rises high
You're loving me so easy
Your wish is my command

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Tell me it won't end
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right
Feels so right

[Outro]
Oh how you feel so right baby

[Verse 1 ]
Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

[Verse 2]
Your true beauty’s description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control, baby you know

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things

Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need

It's time to pack up all the dreams and walk away
No matter what our hearts might say
Now we know we're at the end of a love so it's foolish to pretend why try
We cried clinging to each other tenderly we were the best that we could be
Through the sweet and gentle years and now after all these tears we cried
Love knows we tried
Love knows we tried we gave it all we had and more
Love knows we tried we've got the memory and someday we may see
Goodbye doesn't mean we really didn't try so you can hold your head up high
And as I walk away from you knowing well we did all that we could do inside
Love knows we tried
Oh love knows we tried...
Love knows we tried love knows we tried

1037,Tom T. Hall,41,The All New Me,1981,"

[Verse 1:]
You wake up in the morning drink a beer and take a Valium
And you're trying to forget about the things you did last night
Flip through the morning paper read the horoscope and the comics
You're as well informed as anybody on the left or the right
You make it to your job and hear Atlanta lost another
How can you lose while making half a million bucks or near
The old man who sweeps the floor
And wears a big blue Reagan button
Says the Russians are a coming but they've been here for years

[Chorus:]
Tryin' everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels
It's the all new American diet
Tryin' everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels
You get on it and you're on it for the rest of your life

[Verse 2:]
There's a story in the paper about a man who killed his family
He jumped off a bridge because he couldn't take it anymore
Down at the local tavern a young man comes in limpin'
And he claims that he's a veteran of the Falkland Islands war
You head home and you're accosted by a youngster wearin' robes
And wanting money for his God who sits upon a plastic throne
You ignore him if you can and make it to the local tavern
Where you order up a drink and give some money to your own

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
There's a man in Tennessee who's got it figured out completely
I guess that he's as happy as a thinking man can be
I asked him what he thought and he said brother let me tell you
Try a little bit of both and leave out everything in between

[Chorus]

Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see

Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now looky here gal don't you high hat me
I ain't forgot what you used to be

When you didn't have nothing
That was plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

Now you need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For it don't mean nothing
To me you see

Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me
Now looky here gal you better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf

You're country baby
That's plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see

Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me...

I've known some painted ladies that sparkled in the light
Country girls that loved the lovers moon
Some I never really knew, though I always wanted to
Some I only met once in a room

Some said they liked my smile, others of 'em stayed a while
While others left me on the run
This is the only way, only way I have to say
I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms
And I hope they had some fun

Here's to the ladies in saloons and living rooms
Summer nights that lasted until dawn
Here's to the memories, everyone's a part of me
Oh, I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms

Is there somebody new?

Will I be sweetheart or friend?

Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new

And every time we say goodbye, it gets harder to do
But when I'm far away somewhere alone and the missin' you starts
All I got to do is picture you and I can feel you in my heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
I've been a lot of places but there's just no place like home
And I'm always on my way back to you every minute that I'm gone
So when you get to feelin' lonely just remember we won't always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me and you can feel me in your heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you

I wish my mind wouldn't argue with my heart
It splits the day apart
Into time well spent, and time just thrown away
I wish my heart would please make up my mind
I'm wasting so much time
Gotta catch a glimpse of how it's gonna be

When finally, I look inside your eyes and see
Reflections of yourself in me
The way you always said it would be
When finally, I'm loving you like you love me
It happened oh so easily
I looked at you and it came to me
Finally

This Ferris wheel just keeps on spinning round
Playing mind games with the ground
Can we stop this time, or must we go again
I see you standing waiting just outside
Come and get me off this ride
Wanna lose myself in being here with you

When finally
I look inside your eyes and see
Reflections of yourself in me
The way you always said it would be
When finally
I'm loving you like you love me
It happened oh so easily
I looked at you and it came to me
Finally

To help me get over you
But I'm not blue and all broken in two
Why should I miss you?

Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams
You'll be back and it won't even seem like you're gone
No I won't be alone
Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams

Walk the floor and cry until dawn
Watch the floor and sit by the phone?
Oh no, not me
Why worry and moan just because you're gone?

Cause you'll be back every night in my dreams
You'll be back and it won't even seem like you're gone
No, I won't be alone

Yellow from time
Well worn memories of days gone by
Needing someone and nobody's there
These are the things broken dreams are made of
Lord, they're everywhere

Oh, the tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, tears of the lonely
They never dry

Another nightime that just never ends
A helpless longing for what might have been
Another morning to face all alone
These are the things broken dreams are made of
They go on and on

Oh, the tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, tears of the lonely
They never dry

Oh, the Tears of the lonely
Keep falling all the time
Oh, the tears of the lonely
They never dry...

I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways

Shimmering lips that kiss me
And a body to make a fool of any man
I'd like to run away, but
I just haven't had all that I can stand

Our love is like the darkness
It just keeps on getting deeper with the night
And though we'd never say ""I love you""
You know it feels so good when we get it right

I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways

There's no reason for us to be here
But we are and we have been for some time
Yeah, we both have other lovers, but
What they don't know they sure don't seem to mind

So we throw it to the wind
We don't worry bout these pleasures that we steal
'Cause there's oh so many reasons, but
It's really how we make each other feel

I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways

I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons

For things I left behind
With the years we spent together
There's no telling what I'll find
Its not the keys or the records
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I had it
I was walking out your door

And I came by to get some things
I used to call my own
I didn't think that I'd need them
When I started out alone
It's not the books or the records
But my heart I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I felt it
I was walking out your door

But I don't know where to start
Looking for the lonely heart
Oh I could tear this place apart if you won't mind it
On a shelf behind the book
In the closet on a hook
If you'd only help me look I know I'll find it

I stopped in to tell you
That there isn't any doubt
That the things I left here with you
Are the things I can't live without
You can keep all that I have ever owned
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the the last time I felt it
I was walking out your door

But I don't know where to start
Looking for the lonely heart
Oh I could tear this place apart if you won't mind it
Is it on a shelf behind the book
On a closet on the hook
If you'd only help me look, I know we'll find it

And then we can dance real slow
To something on the radio

Listen to the radio
Oh, listen to the radio
'Let's spend the night together
Baby don't go'
They sing it on the radio

I try to find a way to explain to you
What's on my mind and not sound so plain to you
But you'll realize if you close your eyes
The feelings my words can't show
They're playing on the radio

The words I'd say
Don't seem to sound as real
The songs they play
That's how I really feel, so

When you finally tell me what I know is on your mind
Don't cry, don't let those teardrops start
Just tell me that you're leaving and you'll be gone for good
But speak softly, you're talking to my heart

True love is a treasure that few men ever find
I thought that I'd found it from the start
Now it's over, it's so over
Only a fool would stay to watch it fall apart

How I tried to change your mind
I sold my soul, lost my pride
What's that reflection in your eyes
Is it your plan to love another man?

How I tried to change your mind
I sold my soul, lost my pride
What's that reflection in your eyes
Is it your plan to love another man?

When you finally tell me what I know is on your mind

But speak softly, you're talking to my heart

1056,Lee Greenwood,10,Ring On Her Finger  Time On Her Hands,1982,"

She stood before God, her family and friends
And vowed that she'd never love anyone else again
Only me

As pure as her gown of white she stood by my side
And promised that she'd love me till the day she died
Lord, please forgive her even though she lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard she tried

She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in her wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights she cried herself to sleep
And all the broken promises I somehow failed to keep
I can't blame her

I'm the one who left her too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison she tried to make a home
Her love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
In the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in her wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time....
She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man

Now it's just been two short weeks

But I think there's somethin' that you oughtta know

I've rearranged the livin' room to suit me
I gave your favorite chair to charity
That closet you insisted on, it's mine now
So don't bring your old hangups back to me

I'm wearin' my jeans a little bit tighter
Changed my hair style and I'm learnin' how to dance
So maybe you best wait a little bit longer
'Fore you come back and give me another chance

I thank you for your call but someone's knockin' at the door
And he's drivin' a big old Cadillac
I prob'ly won't be home when you come to get your clothes
There on the back porch in a paper sack

I'm wearin' my jeans a little bit tighter
Changed my hair style and I'm learnin' how to dance

And the TV dinners and the tonic
And gin is eatin' up all my pay

It's a natural fact if you're livin' like that
You won't be livin' long
Takes a whole lotta lovin' from a whole lotta woman
To keep you satisfy and strong

Well, on the outskirts of town there's a lady I've found
Knows how to treat me right
She's gonna take me to the country tonight

She's gonna take me to the country
She's gonna take me to the country
Well there's a woman I found on the outskirts of town
Knows how to treat me right
She's gonna take me to the country tonight

Well, when the weekend comes and the work is done
I'm lookin' for a place to play
I leave the city streets for the trees
And creeks saddle up my Chesapeake Bay

With the moon above and a feelin' for love
We're dancin' on a hardwood floor
It takes a whole lotta lovin' from a whole lotta woman
To keep me comin' back for more

Well, on the outskirts of town there's a lady I've found
Knows how to treat me right
She's gonna take me to the country tonight

She's gonna take me to the country
She's gonna take me to the country

As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see

Darling, don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
You're tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind

You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand

On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey, we're drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darling don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
If you want all night you know it's alright
I've got time

You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush

Who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush

Be coming home soon on leave
I think of her as I stand here on the deck
Stars light the sky
Like a Kansas City night
Reflections on the water takes me back

Chorus:
Kansas City lights
In my mind they shine so bright
She's waiting there, I've been away to long
Kansas City lights
Shine for me tonight
Watch over her for me till I get home

No war is ever won
Find a job that must be done
It's just sometimes, it feels like no one cares
Waves are calm tonight
As I take my pen and write
Your always in my dreams and in my prayers

Chorus
Kansas City lights
In my mind they shine so bright
She's waiting there, I've been away to long

Shine for me tonight
Watch over her for me till I get home

Above the lights of Kansas City
As the plane touches down
I see her standing there right now

Chorus
Kansas City lights
In my mind they shine so bright
She's waiting there, I've been away to long

Shine for me tonight
Watch over her for me till I get home

She's waiting there, I've been away to long
Kansas City lights
Shine for me tonight
Watch over her...

1062,Crystal Gayle,16,You Never Gave Up On Me,1982,"

For all the times you stood by me
Through right and wrong
For being there to catch me when I'd fall
I love you for your faith in me
For all the joys you've given me
But there's one thing makes me love you most of all

You never gave up on me when I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was making
Things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love somebody

And though sometimes we might not see things eye to eye
You've always met me more than half the way
So for all the times I've let you down
And you could have packed your things and gone
I love you most of all because you stayed

And you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Never mattered who was right or wrong
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me
When I was making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love

There were times I just knew you
Did not understand the moods
All those long and sleepless nights I put us through
But you stuck by me anyway
Gave me love everyday
And now there's nothing
In this world I wouldn't do for you

Cause you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when
I was making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love

Cause you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was
Making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love

How many lonely nights...

It happens every time
I think I'm gettin' over you

Gets me thinkin' about you

How many times...

Your memory is there

1066,Charley Pride,20,I Don't Think She's In Love Anymore,1982,"

Well, I came in late again last night
Really, it was this morning
I had my alibi down pat
I was gonna be charming

But the locks were all changed
I was stuck outside
With a key that no longer fit
There was a note on the door
That said, adios, sayonara
Goodbye, this is it

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

So I went down to a phone booth
Almost down to crying
All ready to spill the truth
I see she's tired of my lying

Well, I was all ready to beg and plead
And to turn over a brand new leaf
But the second she heard
It was me on the line
I heard click, she hung up on me

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking the door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

1067,Ronnie Milsap,21,Any Day Now,1982,"

Any day now
I will hear you say
Good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow

Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now, love will let me down
Cause you won't be around

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Any day now
You won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around

[Intro]
You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse]
Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Verse 2]
Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend
Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats

[Bridge]
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that's where music has to start

[Chorus]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

[Outro]
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music

Just as sure as there's gold in California
A jukebox in Tesas guitars down in Tennessee
Just as sure as a peach grows in Georgia
We gonna make it love's found you and me

It's been a long time long time to comin' and you tried other so have I
But love never touched me till you touched me
And you never saw love till you saw it in my eyes
Just as sure as there's gold...

You can look too hot and overlook it never see the forest for the trees
Run your race too fast and never win it
But if love is a gamble they won't bet on you and me
Just as sure as there's gold...
Just as sure as there's gold...
We gonna make it baby love's found you and me

1071,Dolly Parton,25,Single Women,1982,"

Single bars and single women
With a single thought in mind
Just to make it 'til the morning
Looking for what they can find
For a man they won't remember
For a night they can't forget
Do you come to this place often?
May I light your cigarette?

Drinking beer in Amarillo
Passing time and swapping jokes
Hoping for a new beginning
But beginning to lose hope
And you're waiting for that moment
When a glance becomes a stare
Mmm, what's that perfume that you're wearing?
Haven't I met you somewhere?

Find a matchbook in the morning
With a name and number scrawled
When you phone, a woman answers
And you wish you'd never called
Oh, they're friendly when they meet you
But they're strangers when they go
Do you mind if I come join you?
Would you like to dance one more?

And it's getting near to closing
And the seconds pass like years
Lots of friends to share the laughter
Not a one to share the tears
Oh and you wish they'd change that jukebox
'Cause you know every song it plays
Can I drop you off at my place?
Oh, what's the matter? Are you gay?

You got a twenty in your pocket
Got your toothbrush in your purse
Life could get a whole lot better
But it better not get worse
Single bars and single women
With a single thought in mind
Just to make it 'til the morning
Looking for what they can find

1072,John Anderson,26,Would You Catch A Falling Star,1982,"

You know the crowd was very small for a country music show
But he faked a curtain call just like it was years ago
And then a lady grabbed his arm as he staggered down the aisle
And with all his country charm he addressed her with a smile

Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home and he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star

He had a silver plated bus and a million country fans
Now there's just a few of us and he drives a little van
And they were beatin' down his door the lovely women left and right
And now he's on a hardwood floor a wonderin' where he'll spend the night

Would you catch a fallen star before he crashes to the ground
Don't you know how people are nobody loves you when you're down
Pick him up and take him home and he'll bring his old guitar
Sing a golden oldie song if you'll catch a fallen star
Sing a golden country song if you'll catch a fallen star

I'm a charger
That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys' ever had
I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad

I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee

I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
We'll cross the field and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee

I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound and when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun

I've got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number 1 and I'll always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee

I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free
And they'll go swimming compliments of me

The General Lee

Now Lord, I'm no thief
But I could go wrong
I'm so busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
I'm busted

There'll be a rainbow around the moon
You'll fall apart when you hear that tune
Every day will end too soon
When you fall in love

You'll get weak in the knees when you see her smile
You try your best to hide it 'cause it's not your style
You let it get you cryin' like a little child
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It's out of your hands
It gets into your heart
It changes your plans
But you'll only understand
When you fall in love

The summer breeze will chill you to the bone
You'll walk the floor 'til the break of dawn
Sometimes you'll feel so alone
When you fall in love

And you won't notice, but the day that it shows
That light'll follow you wherever you go
And that's how you'll know
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It's out of your hands
It gets into your heart
It changes your plans
But you'll only understand
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It's out of your hands
It gets into your heart
It changes your plans
But you'll only understand
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It's out of your hands
It gets into your heart
It changes your plans
But you'll only understand
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It gets out of your hands
It gets into your heart
It changes your plans

Seem just like a year
Let's count every heartbeat, babe
Before they disappear

Slow down

Let me look you over, baby
Let me tell you this
I'd love to start the lovin'
With this whole world's longest kiss

Slow down, just lay in my arms, oh, I'll slow down

And then I'll love you again
Just slow down

Slow down, we don't have to fight it

I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
Before the Vietnam war came along

Before The Beatles and 'Yesterday
When a man could still work, still would
The best of the free life behind us now
And are the good times really over for good?

Are we rolling down hill
Like a snowball headed for Hell?
With no kind of chance
For the Flag or the Liberty Bell

Wish a Ford and a Chevy
Could still last ten years, like they should
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
Are the good times really over for good?

And a joint was a bad place to be
It was back before Nixon lied to us all on TV

1101,Eddie Rabbitt,5,You Can't Run From Love,1983,"

I took a plane around the world
Trying to lose her memory
But everywhere that I touched down
I found it waiting there for me

You can't run from love, there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You can't run from love
When it's looking for you all you can do is
Give up

Sail across the seven seas
Climb upon the mountain high
Build a wall around your heart
It's going to find you every single time

You can travel in a time machine
Disappear without a trace
It won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place

You can travel in a time machine
Disappear without a trace
It won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place

You can't run from love there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You can't run from love ooh
You can't run from love there's just no place
In this world 'cause I've tried

You can't run from love ooh
You can't run from love

1102,Emmylou Harris,6,I'm Movin' On,1983,"

Yeah, that big eighteen wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' mama ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky, I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland we're comin' to you
I'm movin' on keep rollin' along
Yeah, you had the laugh on me but I've set you free and I'm movin' on

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty daddy in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a roll and keep movin' me on

Mister engineer take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the Southern land
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
You can ease my mind put me there on time and movin' on

I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on keep rollin' along
You have broken your vow and it's all over now I'm movin' on

You switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a trifling woman on my main line
I'm movin' on keep rollin' on
I've warned you twice now you can settle the price, I'm movin' on

"
1103,David Allan Coe,7,The Ride,1983,"

Well I was thumbing from Montgomery
Had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed
Said, ""It's a long walk to Nashville, would you like a ride, son?""

Well I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost-white pale
When he asked me for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

He said
""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?""
He said, ""Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride""

Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said
""This is where you get off boy. I'm goin' back to Alabam.""
As I stepped out of that Cadillac I said, ""Mr., many thanks""
He said, ""You don't have to call me Mister, Mister
The whole world called me Hank

He said
""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?
He said, ""Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride""
He said
""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?

1104,Ronnie Milsap,8,Stranger In My House,1983,"

There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's all right
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Or somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination
Or has her love turned into lies

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

You've got me wanting to be near you
You know I want this love to grow
You say you like to keep things simple
And you don't want any ties
But I see a different story in your eyes&46

I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

You try to act like it don't matter
You said you felt this way before
You say you only want your freedom
And you don't need nothin' more
Here you are just knocking at my door

I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough

Just foolin' when I said that I'd be true

Now you're gone there's an achin' that I can't seem to lose
And I wonder was I ever foolin' you

[Verse 3]
And now that I realize I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me just who the fool could be

[Chorus]
But this time believe me I'm not foolin' you
I just can't talk my heart into unlovin' you

And now that I realize that I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me just who the fool could be

This time believe me I'm not foolin' you
I just can't talk my heart into unlovin' you

As the maid poured wine and we prepared to dine
I knew I was feelin' out of place
At a table as large as a river barge
And ""I love you"" written all on your face

I appreciate your hospitality
But I wish that we would go
Let me drive us to McDonald's and I'll talk to you
Concernin' somethin' you should really know

I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be

I'll take a Chevrolet just any day
So give your daddy back his Mercedes Benz
And there's some common people that I hang out with
They're my good time buddies, they're my friends

And I'd rather chug-a-lug a mug of Budweiser beer
Than sip a crystal glass of wine
So won't you make your mind up to believe in me
And leave this high livin' world behind

I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be

And I'm happy just being free
And I'm happy just being me
And I hope that you will see

I'm just a common man, drive a common van
My dog ain't got a pedigree
If I have my say, it's gonna stay that way
'Cause high-browed people lose their sanity
And a common man is what I'll be

We've both been burned we should have learned
We should have walked right out the door
This is nothin new for me and you
This time it just might work out right
On and on and on the movie goes
Romance is a show they'll never close
Love affairs we've had our shares are we a pair of fools
Should we break the rules or do we dare start another love affair
Those old love songs always turn out wrong
With lovers crying in the night
We know them well but who can tell this time it just might turn out right
On and on and on the movie goes
Romance is a show they'll never close
Love affairs we've had our shares are we a pair of fools
Should we break the rules or do we dare start another love affair

Should we break the rules or do we dare start another love affair
Well I don't care let's start another love affair

I can't work late
Although I need the money
Gotta get home to my lovin honey
She'll be there waitin', waitin' impatiently
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Usually I meet with the boys of Friday
Only this mornin' she said 'this is my day
The look she gave me sent a shiver down into my soul
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll

I'm a songwriter a professional dreamer
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer
I should know if anybody knows at all
When love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

So I gotta go, I gotta get home early
Be with my woman, soft an curvy
Makes me feel like a king
And not a regular Joe
Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll
Our love is on a good roll

Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

Love is on a roll
Love is on a good roll

1113,Gail Davies,17,Singing The Blues,1983,"

I woke up this morning just 'bout half past four
Hesitation blues was knocking on my door

Tell me, how long, do I baby, have to wait
Can I let you know? Why must I hesitate?

Ain't no use in me working so hard
I got me two good women
Working in the rich folks' yard

I ain't your good man
Ain't your good man's son
But I can get in the place of your good man
'til your good man comes

Well, I ain't no miller
Ain't no miller's son
But I can grind a little corn
'til the miller comes

I ain't no wine presser
Ain't no wine presser's son
But I can buy you a little groceries
'til the grocery man cames

I ain't no cradle rocker
Ain't no cradle rocker's son
But I can do a little rockin' for you
'til the rocker man comes

Well, I ain't no doctor
Ain't no doctor's son
But I can cure a few cases
'til the doctor comes

Eagle on the dollar say, ""In God We Trust""
Woman flashy, wants a man but I declare
She want a dollar first

I ain't no bookkeeper
Ain't no bookkeeper's son
But I can keep a few books
'til the bookkeeper comes

I ain't no milkman
Ain't no milkman's son
But I can keep you supplied
'til your milkman comes

I ain't no chauffeur
Ain't no chauffeur's son
But I can do a little driving
'til your chauffeur comes

Well, I ain't no back-breaker
Ain't no back-breaker's son
But I can stretch out my back
'til your back-breaker comes

I ain't got no woman and I ain't got no kid
Ain't got no daughter to be bothered with

I ain't no rent payer
Ain't no rent payer's son
But I can scrape up a few rents
'til the rent payer comes

Well, I ain't been to heaven but I've been told
St. Peter learnt the angels how to do the Jelly Roll

Me and my buddy and two or three more
We get good women everywhere we go

Well, I hitched up the mule
And the mule wouldn't pull
Took the hunches off the mule
And put the hunches on the bull

Blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I'd be a fool if I quit the woman I got
Because it ain't no use

I got hesitating stockings
Hesitating shoes
I got a hesitating woman
Singing me the hesitating blues

My good gal quit me
I ain't going to wear no black
I always got something to make her
Come running back

Men in the country hollering, ""Whoa, haw, gee!""
Women in the city flying around
Asking the question, ""Who wants me?""

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Just show me a woman that a man can trust

You know, my mother told me
When I was just six years old
I'm going to be a good women getter
God bless your soul

1114,Lee Greenwood,18,I.o.u.,1983,"

You believe, that l've changed your life forever
And you're never gonna find another somebody like me
And you wish, you had more than just a lifetime to give back all
I've given you and that's what you believe
But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for
You know that when I'm holding you you're right where you belong
And my love, I can't help but smile with wonder
When you tell me all I've done for you 'Cause I've known all
Along. But I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away
And I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay
'Cause I owe you the sunlight in the morning
And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away. And
I owe you more than life now, more than ever
I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay

Sitting on the front porch
Rain is pouring down
News comes on the radio
There's trouble all around

That's the way it always been
And the way it'll always be
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

The rich keep getting richer
The poor barely get by
Farmer Johnson says it's either
Too wet or too dry

Jobs are scarce down at the factory
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

In times like these
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground

In times like these
Love will pull us through
Baby, I know I can depend on you

We can read about the latest
In the fashion magazines
But that don't change the fact
That we got patches on our jeans

Everybody's needing money
Even the preachers preaching on TV
I thank the good Lord I've got you
In times like these

In times like these
When it's easy to get down
You're my inspiration
You're my solid ground

In times like these
Love will pull us through
Baby, I know I can depend on you

It costs you forty-five cents
For a nickel candy bar
And a dollar's worth of gas
Won't even start your car

Yeah, we got problems
Here in the land of free
But there's no place I'd rather be

In times like these
I thank the good Lord I've got you

In times like these
In times like these, baby

Well, these Highway Forty blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home

Wasted time and money too;
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above, I've paid my dues
Got the Highway Forty blues

The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead!
That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams, my mind is numb
My money's gone, stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway Forty blues

You know, I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone, from town to town
Met pretty girls I have to say
But none of them could make me stay

Well, I've played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars:
Things a country boy can't use
Dixieland I sure miss you
Got the Highway Forty blues...

1118,B.J. Thomas,22,Whatever Happened To Old Fashioned Love,1983,"

We live in the modern age
Where love is fast like a turning page
In a magazine, we've hardly seen
The friends we used to know
They disappear, they come and go
Like the times we've had
It's kind of sad

Whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears

Today is all we've planned
We say tomorrow we'll understand
If it all should end
We'd be alone again

Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears

For now the tenderness
Has been replaced
With something less
And it's hard to find
What we left behind

Ohh, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
Yeah, whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would last through the years
Through the trials
Through the smiles
Through the tears

1119,Gary Morris,23,The Love She Found In Me,1983,"

She looked into a heart so sad
And saw what no one ever had
Beneath the snow she saw the spring
She finds good in everything

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me

She looks beneath each tear that's cried
And somehow sees the sunny side
Even on the darkest night
She knows where to find the light

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me

When the world starts closing in
She gives me strength to smile again

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows

Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me

Way down in Sad Town in the valley of broken dreams
We're both prisoners of past loves and things that'll never be
Somethin' tells me if you held me, the clouds would disappear
We could leave our troubles all behind and nothin' could keep us here

We could soar like an eagle, touch the sky like a dove
We could fly to the top of the world, fly into love
Fly into love

Sunshine all the time is just beyond the hill
True love is waiting there and we can find it still
Your blue eyes are my blue skies, forever is in sight
Let's put our dreams together now and fly away tonight

We could soar like an eagle, touch the sky like a dove
We could fly to the top of the world, fly into love
Fly into love

"
1121,Willie Nelson   Merle Haggard,25,Poncho And Lefty,1983,"

Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes

All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

The poets tell how old Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

A few gray Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

There's just a little fashioned karma coming down
Just a little old fashioned justice going 'round
A little bit of sowing and a little bit of reaping
A little bit of laughing and a little bit of weeping
Just a little old fashioned karma coming down
Coming down coming down just a little old fashioned karma coming down
It really ain't hard to understand
If you're going to dance you got to pay the band
It's just a little old fashioned karma coming down

Wash away my troubles to the sea forever more
Wind and willows whisper, sadness is the sound
Tell a tale of my once-happy world that's fallin' down
Old man, I might be going where you're bound

[Chorus]
Old man river, I've come to talk again
Yes I know you're tired 'cause your journey never ends
She's just like you, she's movin' all the time
And I think she's movin' me out of her mind

I wanna travel with you in your deep and inroad soul
That's the only way to make it peaceful like before
We used to touch at midnight, ah but now I feel she's gone
Even though she's lyin' next to me, I feel alone
Old man, it looks like time to travel on

Oh I think she's movin' me out of her mind
Oh I think she's movin' me out of her mind
Oh I think she's movin' me out of her mind

I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

Could I be dreaming
Is this really real
Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight

Haven't loved you somewhere before
In another time, another place
On some distant shore?

You know me so well
Better than I know myself

And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life
All my life

And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

Love like we made
Could have taken a lifetime to find
But you found the way
To my heart in a moment of time

You know how to care
Just like you've always been there
(Just like you've always been there)
Just like you've always been there

And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life
All my life

And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

With the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

You love me like
You've loved me all my life

I found a cigarette circled with lipstick
And the lingering of perfume in the room
The look on his face was priceless
I don't think he expected me so soon
I'm sure he's got an innocent excuse

Except for the snapshot
He doesn't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot

That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He think he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot

He says he bought the new car
Strictly for business
And the new clothes
Match the new smile on his face

The extra key on his chain must be to the office
Poor baby
Leaving early, staying late
He's got an alibi for every move he makes

Except for the snapshot
He doesn't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot

That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He think he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot

When he comes home tonight
It'll be his surprise
I had it blown up, life size!
(Life size!)
I'm not quite as foolish as you thought I'd be
I took everything

Including the snapshot
He don't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot

That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He thinks he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot

Except for the snapshot
He don't know I've got
(I've got! Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot

That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He thinks he's got one on me
But wait 'til he sees the snapshot

1128,Shelly West,32,Jose Cuervo,1983,"

Well, it's Sunday morning
And the sun in shining in my eye that is open
And my head is spinning
Was the life of the party
I can't stop grinning
I had to much tequila last night

Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime

Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start a fight?

Now wait a minute
Things don't look to familiar
Who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me?
He's awful cute
But how'd I get his shirt on?
I had to much tequila last night

Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime

Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start a fight?

All those little shooters
How I love to drink 'em down
Come on, bartender
Let's have another round

Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high
Tomorrow might be painful
But tonight we're gonna fly
Did I start any fights?

Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime

Every time we get together
I sure have a good time
You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo
(Tequila)

Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime

Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start a fight?

Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine

1129,George Jones,33,I Always Get Lucky With You,1983,"

[Verse One - George Jones]
I've had good luck, and bad luck
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you
I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two
But I always get lucky with you
I keep strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
Hun, I've always got lucky with you

--- Instrumental ---

(Verse Two - Mark Knopfler)
I've keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime
There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you

(Jones & Knopfler)
Oh, I always get lucky with you
I always get lucky with you

1130,Rosanne Cash,34,It Hasn't Happened Yet,1983,"

(John Hiatt)

You said that I would be sorry
If you went away
You said I wouldn't be happy
Without hell to pay
You said the teardrops would fall
Between the bedroom walls
You said that I would regret
But it hasn't happened yet

Your friends come over and offer
To take me to eat
They seem so sorry I'm sufferin'
So much misery
They say to just give a call
Next time that I start to crawl
I always say yeah you bet
But it hasn't happened yet

I don't have anyone
I'm havin' fun
Nobody's into me
No one's a mystery
I see you on the street
My heart don't miss a beat
Love and hostility
Don't mean a thing to me

I find it hard to remember
The good times we had
Call me insensitive
Now that it's over, I'm glad
You said when big shadows fell
It would be too hard to tell
My life from your silhouette
But it hasn't happened yet

Don't hold your breath, baby

1133,Louise Mandrell,37,Save Me,1983,"

The band is coming on
And so are most guys
Approachin' me with their overused lines
And while you slow dance
They try to charm the pants off of you

Through the smoke-filled room
I caught your stare
Though I was cool
You were aware
That I needed someone who would come and answer my prayers

Oh, save me
Take me away to the moonlight
People around
It don't feel right
What are we doing here?

Come on, save me
Let's get away from the action
You are the only attraction
Take me away from here

As you make your way across the floor
I fantasize we were out the door
And on our way to some hideaway for love
You took my hand as if you knew
This was something that I'd never do
And without a word
I heard you say it too

Oh, save me
Take me away to the moonlight
People around
It don't feel right
What are we doing here?

Come on, save me
Let's get away from the action
You are the only attraction
Take me away from here

Loneliness takes willingness
Needs a place to start
Could it be tonight will leave us inside each other's heart?

Oh, save me
Take me away to the moonlight
People around
It don't feel right
What are we doing here?

Come on, save me
Let's get away from the action
You are the only attraction
Take me away from here

Touch me and my world stands still
I know I'm your fool once again
Hold me and it seems as though we're together once again
My darling I should know the score, it's been this way before
So darling, touch me and I'll be your fool once more
Now take me for I'm just a toy
That you play with when there's no one else around
And my world will be waiting here
When your world comes tumbling down
I said, I beg you please don't leave but it's only make believe
So darling, touch me and I'll be your fool once more
You know just how to keep me dangling on your string
Oh, but you see, your puppet he's danced for the last time

For all the heartaches that you bring
I know that it's wrong, I know it's wrong to love you so
Oh, but I just, I can't let you go
So darling, touch me and I'll be your fool once more
So darling, touch me and I'll be your fool once more

1136,Earl Thomas Conley,40,Your Love's On The Line,1983,"

You've never cheated, you've never lied
You've never had feelin's that you've had to hide
For she's got you thinkin' of somethin' so different tonight
It's too late to worry what's right or what's wrong
And you're a little too crazy to leave it alone
When you're lookin' at somethin' that's too good to push it aside

Boy, she's got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
How come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

You still think your 1st love's the best in your life
When you know you should hurry, but you can't say goodbye
And you know you can't go back and feel like you're where you belong
Now the sweet taste of freedom is hard to control
When the touch of a woman's so tender to hold
She won't even let you remember how long you've been gone

Boy, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

Boy, you've got your head in the clouds
And your heart in a bind
So how come you're feelin' so proud
When your love's on the line?

1137,Ray Charles,41,3/4 Time,1983,"

I like enchiladas and old El Dorados that shine
My old friend the guitar and songs and women and wine
They say that I'm livin' too fast, but I'm feelin' fine (yeah)
And I just keep easin' along in 3/4 time

Sometimes I get sideways and stay up all night writin' songs
They say it ain't healthy, but somehow I keep goin' on (I do)
I write what I feel and don't care if the damn thing don't rhyme (no)
Just gimme a C-chord and play it in 3/4 time (got it)

[Chorus]
It's a big old world and we all have to live out our lives
And one thing's for sure: ain't none of us gonna get out alive(sorry)

So while I'm still kickin', I'm gonna keep pickin' my tunes
I like what I'm doin' and I hope it don't end too soon
'Cause all of my life there's one thing I keep hopin' to find (yes)
A woman who likes to make love in 3/4 time (be nice, ya know)

Got my eye on a boy
He's eying me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
But I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away

He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women
Would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

Pretty as a picture
Coming on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a waste of time to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all yours
Until then

Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They're crowding in on me
Moving in suspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Working up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a waste of time to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

When she walks in the room, everybody gets quiet
You can hear hearts start beating inside
And the way that she moves
You just can't deny it
They all wish that they could hold her
You can see it in their eyes

She's everybody's dream girl
Everybody's dream girl
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

Well, I woke up this morning
Found that determined
That today was gonna be the day
And I gathered all my courage
Walked right up to her
I stumbled and I fumbled for the right words to say

She's everybody's dream girl
Oh, everybody's dream girl
I got to make her mine
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

One way or another
Gonna tell her that I love her
I keep trying every day
'Til I find a way

Everybody's dream girl
Oh, she's everybody's dream girl
I wanna make her mine
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

I got to find a way
Everybody's dream girl
Maybe today's the day

Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonder land that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watching you grow and going through the changes in your life
That's how I know I'll always wanna be there

Whenever you call you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your morning...

And before you leave our room, put on your best perfume

Just the thought of seeing me won't make you fightin' mad
Maybe next time we'll have a better day
And you won't criticize and tear apart everything I say
Maybe next time
You've got every reason to feel the way you do
It's up to me to make things right
I'm here asking darling if you'll tell me what to do
I'll start doing it tonight
Maybe next time I won't be left in the rain
Cryin' out like some lovesick fool half insane
Maybe next time we could take a little walk
In the cool of the night and have a heart to heart talk
Maybe next time

You've got every reason...
Maybe next time I won't be left in the rain...
Maybe next time

Thought he was my friend
The landlord said that bob's not here
""The Police done hauled him in!""
I ran right back to little honey's house

I'm gonna rock on away from here""

To all the girls I've loved before
Who travelled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls I once caressed
And may I say I've held the best
For helping me to grow
I owe a lot I know
To all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing
And they just carry me away

To all the girls who shared my life
Who now are someone else's wives
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls who cared for me
Who filled my nights with ecstasy
They live within my heart
I'll always be a part
Of all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing
And they just carry me away

To all the girls we've loved before
Who travelled in and out our doors
We're glad they came along

Who travelled in and out our doors

Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

And the eyes that used to burn for me
Now they no longer look my way
And the love that used to be
Why it just got lost in yesterday
And if she seems cold to the touch
Well, there used to be a flame
I gave too little, took too much
'Till I erased the painter's name

Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

Down on the beach drinkin' coke and rum
You wouldn't know me with this golden glow
Soakin' sun in Mexico

Doin' everything I said I would
I should have left a long time ago
Who needs you? I got Mexico

Through it all nothing's really changed
No matter what honey that's a shame
I still love you that's the way it goes
He's got you, I've got Mexico

Who needs you? I got Mexico

I'm eatin right and I'm livin good

You make it easy to be strong
With just a little love

Everything will work out right
Because I'll still hold you tight, in my dreams

But it's better to quit than to sit each night and cry
I'd rather know the truth than to live through a life of lies

Maybe it's for the best to give this love of ours a rest
But I'll come running back if you want me

Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds
When we make love

[Verse 2]
Watching you
Make your little moves
I can tell it's gonna be a long night
All day long
We keep holdin' on
It couldn't be any better than this
I got it all at my finger tips

[Chorus]
When we make love
Oh, It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds

[Bridge]
These moments
These feelings
Mmmmmm

[Chorus]
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
We share our hearts, our souls and our minds

[Outro]
Now let's make love
Sweet love

"
1160,Louise Mandrell,14,I'm Not Through Loving You Yet,1984,"

You got that looking around look in your eyes
You got a restless ache you want to satisfy
But while you're thinking about who you can love

You better keep in mind
Just what you're giving up
Stop acting like you've already left
I'm not through loving you yet

Don't you turn your back
Don't you act like that
Don't do anything you'll regret
If you're thinking free
Think differently and never forget
I'm not through loving you yet

Because there's someone out there you haven't tried
Don't mean that what you want
Is what you're gonna find
I've always taken you where you want to be

So don't go somewhere else
For what you got with me
I'll show you I meant it when I said
I'm not through loving you yet

Don't you turn your back
Don't you act like that
Don't do anything you'll regret
If you're thinking free think differently
And never forget
I'm not through loving you yet

No, don't you turn your back
Don't you act like that
Don't do anything you'll regret
If you're thinking free think differently
And never forget
I'm not through loving you yet

"
1161,Gene Watson,15,Forever Again,1984,"

I wish I could step out of my mind
Then I could be someone that's never known you
But I can't change the way I am much less the way you feel
Or you'd be loving me forever still

I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again

If I had a way of changing time
I'd stay busy turning back the pages
If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you
And you'd be loving me forever too

I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again, you'd love me forever again

"
1162,Conway Twitty,16,Somebody's Needin' Somebody,1984,"

(Len Chera)

Someone somewhere's fallin' asleep
In a chair in front of the tv
'Cross town somebody's
Up and walkin' the floor at a quarter to three

In some little corner of the world
A forgotten soul is waitin' by the phone
And right down the hall someone's in there feelin'
Like cryin' 'cause they're livin' all alone

Somebody's needin' somebody the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody somewhere waitin' for me

Late at night it's lonely and I wonder how I'll ever get through
There's got to be somebody somewhere who's feelin' it too
Hurtin' inside, goin' through the motions, it's so hard to live
So many feelin' so lonely when they got so much to give

Somebody's needin' somebody the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody somewhere waitin' for me

To be loved by somebody that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody out there waitin' for me...

1163,Exile,17,I Don't Wanna Be A Memory,1984,"

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
Wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be a memory

Don't you remember how it used to be
When we were so in love
We spent the nights in a two-room flat
Drinking wine from a coffee cup

Making love was so very easy
We couldn't get enough
I never dreamed there would come a time
When you'd think about giving me up

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be a memory

I know you've had other lovers
But that's all history
I got to know that you'll let me be the last one
To share your company

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind
I don't want to be a memory

1164,Steve Wariner,18,Why Goodbye,1984,"

I look out my window to wish upon my star
And dig out those old memories that's hidden in my heart
But the stars ain't coming out tonight, dark clouds win again
'Cause there's another lonely night movin' in
Why goodbye, why goodbye
Am I blue, my oh my
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
So why goodbye, why goodbye
On the day I met you there was love light in your eyes
Yesterday you walked away and didn't even cry
And as I sit alone tonight and think of all we had
Your leavin' me is leavin' me so sad
Why goodbye, why goodbye
Am I blue, my oh my
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
So why goodbye, why goodbye
Why goodbye
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
Why goodbye, why goodbye
It's just another lonely night, why goodbye
Why goodbye, why goodbye
It's just another lonely night, why goodbye

"
1165,Kenny Rogers And Dottie West,19,Together Again,1984,"

Together again - my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights - are now at an end
The key to my heart - you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters now - we're together again
Together again - the grey skies are gone
And you're back in my arms - right back where you belong
The love that I knew - is living again
And nothing else matters girl - we're together again
Together again - my tears have stopped falling
You're back in my arms - and we're together again
Again

1166,Waylon Jennings,20,I May Be Used (but Baby I Ain't Used Up),1984,"

[Intro]
Well my baby you're a looker and I know what you're looking for
You've been looking over, every man at the bar
Honey, I know I've got a few years on you
But if you're shopping around let me tell you a thing or two

[Verse 1]
Well I look a little rough and I got a few miles on me
My body needs work and my style ain't what it used to be
And honey I'll admit there's places where I'm wearing thin
But I ain't broke down, I'm just getting broken in

[Chorus]
Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about
I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love
Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up

[Verse 2]
I've been wrecked a few times and honey it shows I guess
There's been once or twice that you could say that I was repossessed
There's one little thing that I think ought to be understood
It ain't how you look, it's what you got under your hood

[Chorus]
Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about
I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love
Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up

"
1167,Gary Morris,21,Between Two Fires,1984,"

We've shared so much together
For so long now
I could never turn my back on you
And just walk out

How could I leave you
When you've been so forgiving?
But living without her love
Don't feel like much like living

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Lyin' close beside you
After the love we've made
Another face flickers in my mind
And takes me miles away

I've tried so hard to fight it
But I can't fight anymore
My heart is so divided girl
In this tug of war

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

"
1168,Ronnie McDowell,22,I Dream Of Women Like You,1984,"

You'd think a man my age would know what to say
But look at me
I'm all choked up
Guess I never believed it could happen to me

This love-at-first-sight kind of love
I'm not sure where to start
I'll just pour out my heart
Or maybe I can say it like this

I dream of women like you
Those eyes
Those lips
The way you move

I'd like to know how it feels
Just once, to touch
Something too good to be true
I dream of women like you

You must think I'm a fool and not very cool
And someone you could easily doubt
Ah, but when you walked in
I knew right then
The feeling turned me inside out

No, I'm not playing games
Just let me explain
Won't you give a man a chance?

I dream of women like you
Those eyes
Those lips
The way you move

I'd like to know how it feels
Just once, to touch
Something too good to be true
I dream of women like you

I'd like to know how it feels
Just once to touch
Something too good to be true
I dream of women like you

I'd like to know how it feels
Just once to touch
Something too good to be true
I dream of women like you

1169,Charly McClain,23,Band Of Gold,1984,"

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dream I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memory of what love could be
If you are still here with me

You took me from the shelter of a mother I had never known
Or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'll walk
Back through that door
And love me like you did before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dream I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'll walk
Back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dream I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you are still here with me

1170,The Oak Ridge Boys,24,I Guess It Never Hurts To Hurt Sometimes,1984,"

Sometimes I feel the wave
Of a past break in my mind
And I know it's gone for good
And it makes me want to cry
Is this all we get to keep
As the years go rolling by?
Just a memory
For all the days gone by

Oh you're always in my heart
And you're often on my mind
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes

You try and hold on to the moment
But time won't let you stay
But for every step you take
You lose something on the way
You can't look forward to tomorrow
And still hold on to yesterday
Oh I hope that you can hear me
When I'm saying

Oh you're always in my heart
And you're often on my mind
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes

Oh you're always in my heart (always in my heart)
And you're often on my mind (often on my mind)
I will never let it die
Just as long as I'm alive
Sometimes it makes me sad
That we never said goodbye
Well I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes
No I guess it never hurts
To hurt sometimes

Summertime in Georgia

Don't wipe away my mem'ries

The way it was always seems better

[Verse 1]
I'm strong, I'm sure, I'm in control, a lady with a plan
Believing that life is a neat little package I hold in my hand
I've got it together, they call me the girl who knows just what to say and do
Still, I fumble and fall, run into the wall, 'cause when it comes to you

[Chorus]
I'm just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman, just another woman in love

[Verse 2]
So pardon me if I should stare and tremble like a child
That wanting me look all over your face is driving me wild
I'm just what you make me, can't wait till you take me and set all my feelings free
I know that you can, so come be my man, tonight I want to be

[Chorus]
I'm just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman, just another woman in love
Just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman

You're not meant to be alone
I'll share your dream
I'll show you love you've never known
Two flames together in the deep of the night
I'm up in your love

Close by you when you call
I'll take my stand
One chance to make or lost it all
This time my journey to wherever you are
I sail on your river so far my love we'll never be found
If you believe

We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
And in the light of close investigation
Is it only my imagination
I got you

Moonlight shining on your face
My bridges burned
With all my tears that you replaced
Two hearts together is a beautiful sight
I'll take you to heaven so far my love will follow you there
If we believe

We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
Am I the light of someone you need more of
Let me be that love you can be sure of
Is it only my imagination
I got you

Like the eagle that flies in the sun
I'll be lost in your fire before we are done
And the view from my window is brighter
Born to be all you need

We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
Am I the light of someone you need more of
Let me be that love you can be sure of
Is it only my imagination
I got you...

You were just another pretty face in the crowd
I was just hangin' out
I wasn't ready for love when I looked in your eyes
You took me by surprise
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna stay for the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
And leave me with stars in my eyes

Oh angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

Almost made it too easy for me to believe
That love could happen to me
But you're not afraid to show me how much you care
And prove your heart is there
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna spend the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
And leave me with stars in my eyes

Oh angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

A campfire, some coffee
From a tin cup in my hand
Sure warms the fingers when it's cold ...
Aplayin' an old guitar
A friend I understand
Sure smoothes the wrinkles in my soul ...

Asleepin' in the moonlight
A blanket for my bed
Leaves a peaceful feelin' in my mind ...
Wakin' up in the mornin'
With an eagle overhead
Makes me want to fly away before my time

And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide open spaces from the start ...
He made grass and trees and mountains
And a horse to be a friend
And trails to lead old cowboys home a-gain ...

Night life and big cities
Is alright for awhile
Sure makes you feel good when you're there ...
But the country's so pretty
It goes on and on for miles takes away my troubles and my cares ...

And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide open spaces from the start ...
He made grass and trees and mountains
And a horse to be a friend
And trails to lead old cowboys home a-gain ...

And trails to lead old cowboys home again

'Cause I'm not the trusting kind
But now I'm convinced
That he's heaven sent
And must be out of his mind

Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in my life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so loved
He beats all I've ever seen
Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me

And, Mama, you've always said
Better look before you leap
Maybe so, but here I go
Lettin' my heart lead me
He thinks I hung the moon and stars
I think he's a livin' dream
Well, there are men
But ones like him
Are few and far between

Crazy over me

Before you leap

And your fading heart is beating still
If the fall don't get you
Baby, the heartache will

The heartache, the heartache will
The heartache, the heartache will

One law of love I know is true
What goes up must come down
Well, it happened to me, it can happen to you
I'm just lucky to still be around

I know what I say right now
Don't make much sense
You should listen
To the voice of experience

If the fall don't get you, baby
And your fading heart is beating still
If the fall don't get you
Baby, the heartache will

The heartache, the heartache will

Sometimes you feel lost and far from home
Then with just one kiss you're a king on a throne
It can make you soar like an eagle
Or it can make you feel as meek as a dove
Whoa, that's the thing about love

You hope and pray the right one comes along
Some fools don't know what they've got till its gone
The very one you think will never hurt ya
Always seems to be, the one that does
Whoa, that's the thing about love

You can't have it
Until you give it
You can never give it enough
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Naw, you can't have it
Until you give it
You can never give it enough

Well, next time you come in a natural flow
Deep in the feelin's with your heart all aglow
Don't stop to try to understand it
Just thank your lucky stars, shinin' above, and say
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Whoa, that's the thing about love...

It came to me again tonight
Here in this smoky place
Suddenly a fleeting memory
In the image of your face

So I paid for my check, buttoned my coat
Stepped into an evening rain
Made my way down the avenue
Softly whispering your name

Still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me
Keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you

I dialed your number long distance
I heard a stranger say
The party you have tried to reach
Has recently moved away

I was a fool for leaving you
When you needed me so much
Now I'm the victim of a restless heart
That refuses to forget your touch

Still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me just keeps hanging on
Even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you

Maybe someday I'll learn
To live with this regret
Till then my heart will go on
Trying to forget

That I'm still losing you, still losing you
Something inside of me keeps hanging on
Even though you're gone
Still losing you, oh, I'm still losing you...

1189,John Anderson,44,I Wish I Could Write You A Song,1984,"

I wish, I could sit down and write you a song
One that would play forever so long
It would haunt you wherever you go
And it'd be about you and you'd know

I hope that you'd hear it alone in your car
And you'd pull off the road wherever you are
And you'd cry cause you done me wrong
Oh, I wish I could write you a song

I wish, I could sit down and write you a song
One that would play forever so long
It would haunt you wherever you go
And it'd be about you and you'd know

Singing sweet country music
Breathing clean mountain air
Singing sweet country music
Makes me wish that I was there

It's been more than a year now
Since my daddy had passed away
But I keep his memory with me
In the songs we used to play

Singing sweet country music
Breathing clean mountain air
Singing sweet country music
Makes me wish that I was there

Well, he'd lean back in his rocker
With a bible in his hand
And he'd talk about religion
And just how to work the land

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by, Lord, by and by
(By and by)
There's a better home a waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Singing sweet country music
Breathing clean mountain air
Singing sweet country music
Makes me wish that I was there

Makes me wish that I was there
Makes me wish that I was there

(Wish that I was there)
Sweet country music
(Wish that I was there)
Among that sweet country music

(Oh, I wish that I was there)
Singing sweet country music
Sweet country music

It's just a year today
One year since he went away
So, happy birthday dear heartache
You're one year old today

There'll be the cake tonight
One candle I'm gonna light
So, happy birthday dear heartache
Old love still burns tonight

When he walked out, I felt my heart break
That's when you came to me, dear heartache
You made my heart your home
Now look, how big you've grown

Looks like each guest is here
The blues, the memories and the tears
So, happy birthday dear heartache
Same time, same place next year

So, happy birthday dear heartache
Same time, same place next year

1194,Michael Martin Murphey,49,Disenchanted,1984,"

She used to hang on every word
That rolled off my silver tongue
And she believed every single line
In every song I sung

She thought that I hung the moon
That I could do no wrong
But I cheated and mistreated her
Then I found out I needed her
Now look who's hangin' on

She's disenchanted, disenchanted with me
I took her for granted
Now she's disenchanted with me

I didn't call when I said I would
When I stayed out late at night
And I was always the last one to apologize
Anytime we had a fight

Forgotten dates unopened champagne
Things I should have said
I used to really turn her on
Now I can't even turn her head

She's disenchanted, disenchanted with me
I took her for granted
Now she's disenchanted with me

She's disenchanted, disenchanted with me
Why did I take her for granted
Now she's disenchanted with me
Disenchanted with me

Married at 16
Two kids by 21
But he couldn't take it
Now she's raising them on her own

Between the bills and the laundry
Sometimes she's so lonely she cries
But she's found an escape
From some of the aching inside

She's got a radio heart
She loves the songs they play
They take him off her mind
She's got a radio heart
It helps fill an empty space he left behind

She gets lost in a steel guitar
Oh it's her way out when the heartache starts
She's found a little salvation in a local station
She's got a radio heart

She'll finish clearin' the table
And put the kids off to bed
She tries to watch an old movie
But she thinks of him instead

She lies alone in the dark
And stares at the lighted dial
She gets into the music
And out of this world for a while

She's got a radio heart
She loves the songs they play
They take him off her mind
She's got a radio heart
It helps fill an empty space he left behind

She gets lost in a steel guitar
Oh, it's her way out when the heartache starts
She's found a little salvation in a local station
She's got a radio heart
She's got a radio heart

Somebody's reaching
Somebody's touching

One simple glance can start a romance

Next thing you know

Next thing you know
They're fallin' in love

Sends your heart a reelin'

You're fallin' in love
Fallin' in love

Somebody whispers
Somebody shivers
He's saying something she wants to hear
Somebody's watching

Wondering just how good it must feel

1199,Conway Twitty,3,Don't Call Him A Cowboy,1985,"

So you came from New York city
And you want to see the sights
You've heard all about those cowboys
And those crazy Texas nights

I see you've got your eye on something
Leaning on the bar
But the toughest ride he's ever had
Was in his foreign car

Chorus:
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride

He's the Hollywood idea
Of the wild andd wooly west
In his french designer blue jeans
And his custom tailored vest
You think he's the real thing
But I think you oughta know
He can't even make it through
A one night rodeo. No

Chorus:
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside. no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride

Don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside. no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride

Don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride...

[Verse 1]
You stayed with me through thick and thin
You watched me lose, you watched me win
You picked me up off of the ground
You never one time let me down

[Chorus]
And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

[Verse 2]
I was drowning in a sea of make-believe
As helpless as a falling leave
You gave your hand to me that day
And you did it, because you're made that way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You always seem to let your feelings show
You love me and you let me know
Darling just remember these three words
I love you [x3]

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

Shinin' up through his shoes
Underneath I'm just a cotton picker
Pickin' out a mess of blues

Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

I may look like a bank teller
Pushing facts in a file
But I'd rather be a haul collar
Shooing foot home in style

Show me where I start
Find a horse and cart
I'm just a country boy
Country boy at heart

I may look like a city slicker

Ever since I've known you
You've belonged to someone else
So we've never talked about romance
But I think it's time I told you the way I've always felt
And what I'd do if I got the chance

I'd make love to you in a New York minute
And take my Texas time doing it
I'd do you every way but wrong
I'd make love to you in a New York minute
And take my Texas time doing it
I'd prove to you that in my arms is where you belong

Don't misunderstand me
I wouldn't steal you from your man
But if he's ever fool enough to leave

Well, you know how to reach me
And you know where I am
And you know what I'd do if you were free

I'd make love to you in a New York minute
And take my Texas time doing it
I'd do you every way but wrong
I'd make love to you in a New York minute
And take my Texas time doing it
I'd prove to you that in my arms is where you belong

I'd make love to you in a New York minute
And take my Texas time doing it

1203,The Oak Ridge Boys,7,Little Things,1985,"

It's the way you kiss me when we're walkin' down the street
It's the words you whisper when we're driftin' off to sleep
A certain way you touch me, the way you say ""hello""
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so

The way you pour your coffee in the early morning light
The way you call my name out in the middle of the night
How you sit for hours singing with the radio
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so

It's not the memories or all that we've been through
It's not the distant dreams that keep me coming back to you
It's not the promises that keep me warm at night
It's just the every day, it's just the safe and sound
It's just our home sweet home

And when we're old and grey now and the kids have gone away
We're alone together I may turn to you and say
There's something I forgot to tell you and by now I think you'll know
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so
Woah woah, baby it's the little things that make me love you so

Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, woh
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, woh
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so, woh, woh, who

Walkin' in the park, kissin' in the dark
The little things that baby makes me feel alright now
Baby it's the little things that make me love you
Baby it's the little things that make me love you
Baby it's the little things that make me love you so

1204,Barbara Mandrell,8,There's No Love In Tennessee,1985,"

That big river's still rollin' through Memphis
And on Beale street they still play the blues
The smokie's still wear their halos
It's heaven on earth in the mornin' dew

They still make Jack Daniels in Lynchburg
On the Opry, Mr Acuff's still keen
You can get the best biscuits and gravy
And Loretta can still really sing

But there's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again

There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee

Remember up on look out mountain
Our future seemed so clear
Too bad, Colorado came between us
Now I'll lookin' out through these tears

But I still love the magic of Dixie
Whoever said it gets in your blood, was right
There's still no place better than home sweet home
But there's somethin' missin' tonight

There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again

There's no love in Tennessee
I know it's a beautiful place to be
But without you here with me
There's no love in Tennessee

There's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again
There's no love in Tennessee

1205,Mark Gray & Tammy Wynette,9,Sometimes When We Touch,1985,"

You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
Id rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
At times Id like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times Id like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I watched while love commands you
And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold ya till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Subsides

1206,Ronnie Milsap,10,She Keeps The Home Fires Burning,1985,"

Crack of dawn, I hit the road
Set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again
He can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh, and it's her warm loving
That keeps me returning again and again

Out of gas, just my luck
Four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

Homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain

1207,Crystal Gayle,11,Nobody Wants To Be Alone,1985,"

I've spent my life trying to tell everyone
I've got myself I don't need anyone
You heard the words but you looked in my eyes
And saw the wall of tears I was hiding behind

You reached for me, I felt your touch
I wanted you we both needed so much
In a world of lonely people looking for love
Why was I suprised to see it happen to us

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody wants to love someone
When the nights are long and cold
Everybody needs someone to love
Nobody wants to be alone

The days were empty, the nights were so long
I wished on every star til you came along
I knew that one day you'd walk through that door
Sometimes it's hard but love is worth waiting for

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody wants to love someone
When the nights are long and cold
Everybody needs someone to love
Nobody wants to be alone

Now when you see me cry
You'll only see tears of joy in my eyes
In a world of lonely people looking for love
I wish everyone could be as lucky as us

In the heat of the day down in mobile alabama
Workin' on the railroad with a steel drivin' hammer
Gotta get some money, buy some brand new shoes
Try to find somebody to take away these blues
She don't love me here I'm sing in the sun
Pay day is coming when my work is all done

Up and in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I've been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sittin' in a tee-pee built right on the tracks
Rollin' them bones til the foreman comes back
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off scheduled train comin' two miles out

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll lord, let it roll
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off scheduled train comin' two miles out

Everybody's scramblin' and a jumpin' around
Pickin' up the money and tearing the tee-pee down
The foreman's about to panic and a go insane
Tryin' to get the workers out of the way of the train
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop a train you've got to let it roll on

Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll lord, let it roll
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop a train you've got to let it roll on

Stumble from my good warm bed
Monday mornin', oh my head
Gotta go & do it all again
Wake up baby, rise & shine
It's coffee, eggs & bacon time
Walk your workin' man out to the car

The boss is in his usual mood
Not one thing does he approve
Sometimes you can't keep him satisfied
Up & down the assembly line
Weary faces much like mine
Showing the wear & tear in their eyes

They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man

Big policeman in his prime
Sits behind his billboard sign
Aims his radar gun right straight at me
A letter from the IRS
Says ""Boy, you're taxes are a mess""
Is this the way the good life's supposed to be?

They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man

Stumble from my good warm bed
Monday mornin', oh my head
Gotta go & do it all again
Too much room in the Frigidaire
The kids all need new shoes to wear
Payment's late on my old truck again

They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands
Heaven, help him if you think you can
They're makin' it hard on the workin' man

They're makin' it hard on the workin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' any way he can
Makin' ends meet on the installment plan
His money goes right through his hands

1210,Exile,14,She's A Miracle,1985,"

I don't need a shooting star
To make my wish come true
I don't need a four-leaf clover
Or a crystal ball to see through
Don't need a claim to fame
Like some folks always do
Got my very own big-time star
And she shines the whole night through

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle to me

I don't need any good-luck charms
Always hanging around
Don't need any wishing well
To throw my money down
Don't need to make the front-page news
Be the talk of the town
I'm telling all the world, I've got a heavenly girl
Right here on the ground

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle to me

She's everything in the world to me
A beautiful dream come true
Every day I count my blessings
'Cause I'm the lucky one she gives her loving to

Oh, she's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go
If I stumble, and if I fall
She's waiting right there to catch me, oh
She's a miracle, a miracle

She's a miracle, a sight to see
Oh, the way she touches me
Way down deep in my soul
Something's got a hold and it won't let go...

1211,Emmylou Harris,15,White Line,1985,"

[Verse 1]
It seems like I was there from the start
A witness to your wild and reckless heart
You showed me the way but now you're gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaw's gun
Living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me on

[Chorus]
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight blind, driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away

[Verse 2]
We worked the road as hard as we could drive her
But now I am the only survivor
From night to night at every place I play in
The sweetness of your song remains
I'll be the keeper of the flame
Until every soul hears what your heart was saying

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All the nights you spent alone
All the love I'd never shown
All the words I could not say
Till that white line took you away
White line took you away

[Verse 3]
I'll follow this white line down where it's winding
Because somewhere up ahead your light's still shining
The sound of the silver strings will guide me
I've stood and watched the bridges burn
I'm past the point of no return
Oh, how I wish that you were here beside me

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
White line took my baby
Led him down

1212,Dan Seals,16,My Old Yellow Car,1985,"

She weren't much to look at, she weren't much to ride
She was missing a window on her passenger side
The floorboard was patched up with paper and tar
But I really was something in my old yellow car

An American boy with his hands on the wheel
Of a dream that was made of American steel
Though the seats had the smell of a nickel cigar
I really was something in my old yellow car

Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
There's a rusty old shell of an automobile
And if engines could run on desires alone
That old yellow car would be driving me home

There's the seat where poor Billy threw up on his date
And where Larry and Sandy could no longer wait
There was no road too winding and nowhere too far
With two bucks of gas and my old yellow car

Somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
Thee's a rusty old shell of an automobile
And if engines could run on desires alone
That old yellow car would be driving me home

Take a look at me now throwing money around
I'm paying somebody to drive me downtown
Got a Mercedes Benz with a TV and bar
And God I wish I was driving my old yellow car

God I wish I was driving my old yellow car

Forgiving you was easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time
I just keep thinking
And your memory is forever on my mind

[Chorus]
You know I'll always love you
And I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

[Verse 2]
The bitter fruit of anger
Growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh, what a heartache
But I forgive the things you said to me

[Chorus]
You know I'll always love you
And I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

[Verse 3]
The years have passed so quickly
As once again fate steals a young man's dreams
Of all the golden years
And growing old together you and me

[Chorus]
You know I'll always love you
And I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

You know I'll always love you
And I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy
But forgetting seems to take the longest time

1214,Sawyer Brown,18,Step That Step,1985,"

Mama told me when I was three
The street'll never get you nowhere
You take a street car jumpin' and back beat bump
And get along like it isn't there
You hold your head up high
Like you're gonna fly

You take the bitter 'til you find the sweet
And when you got that crowd and it's screamin' loud
You leave them sittin' on the edge of their seat

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

Hollywood, if New York could
Keep you babblin' 'til the break of day
No time to rest and you've got to feel blessed
'Cause you're gonna get it anyway
You start to wail and your face turns pale
You've got to pump it 'til your pistol pops
And as the eagle flew, baby, so will you
'Cause you're climbin' all the way to the top

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey, talk that talk

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk

But I paid no mind
I just kept on
Rolling on

I saw that warning sign
But I had no time
I was
Headin' for your arms

I saw that warning sign
But I just went blind
Never read a word
That it said

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, ""Danger, heartbreak ahead""

I saw that warning sign
It was in your eyes
It was flashing off and on

I saw that warning sign
But I kissed your lips
I just couldn't do no wrong

I saw that warning sign
And it felt so fine
I fall in love with every word you say

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, ""Danger, heartbreak ahead""

I saw that warning sign
But I just went blind
Never read a word
That it said

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
Danger, heartbreak ahead
I never read a word it said
But it said, ""Danger, heartbreak ahead""

Danger ahead

"
1217,Lee Greenwood,21,Dixie Road,1985,"

I would pick and we would sing to the rhythm of that front porch swing
The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

She said, I love you more than to hold you down, boy you're glory bound
We can't share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too, but someone else made hers come true
Now I'm a star, but every time I sing

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road

Every night I'm in a different place and I'm searching every stranger's face
Trying to find the girl that's just not there
She's back there in Montegomery and I'm clear across the country
But whenever I'm alone I go back there

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road

My heart goes drifting down a dusty dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the dixie road

1218,Steve Wariner,22,Heart Trouble,1985,"

[Chorus]
You're givin' me heart trouble
Never had a lover
Every play with my heart this way
You're a regular heartache
You're givin' me heart trouble
You tell me that you want me
Then you turn around and turn me away
You're hot and you're cold
You say yes and then no
I can't get no relief
You're heart trouble to me

[Verse 1]
Since you laid your temptin' eyes upon me
My life's been one long and sleepless night
Some nights I spend lovin' you
And some nights I'm just tossin' and turnin' blue

[Chorus]
You're givin' me heart trouble
Never had a lover
Ever play with my heart this way
You're a regular heartache
You're givin' me heart trouble
You tell me that you want me
Then you turn around and turn me away
You're hot and you're cold
You say yes and then no
I can't get no relief
You're heart trouble to me

[Verse 2]
When I get my nerve up to tell you goodbye
Just one kiss and you change my point of view
Still I can't help but wonder
How many others are under the spell I'm under

[Chorus]
You're givin' me heart trouble
Never had a lover
Ever play with my heart this way
You're a regular heartache
You're givin' me heart trouble
You tell me that you want me
Then you turn around and turn me away
You're hot and you're cold
You say yes and then no
I can't get no relief
You're heart trouble to me

You're givin' me heart trouble
You've givin' me heart trouble
You're givin' me heart trouble

1219,The Statler Brothers,23,Hello Mary Lou,1985,"

Passed me by one summer day, flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oh, I wanted you forevermore
I'm not one that gets around, swear my feet's stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

I saw your lips, I heard your voice, believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night, arms around you good an' tight
And thats all I had to see for me to say

Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

Now I thought it over how it's come to this
I must have lost all my common sense
I been chasin' a dream runnin' through my mind
So I called her up to say how I felt
Just before I could get it out she was gone, the silence was on
She didn't hear a word, she just hung up the phone

Chorus:
Operator, operator, could you be so kind
As to reconnect this number, I just spent my last dime
She's got my love on hold and my heart is on the line

Well I was always just one step ahead
Just close to keep my fingers wet
I been actin a fool and foolin no one but myself
But now I'm ready to talk if you're willing to hear
The choice of words is my biggest fear, I'd say anything, yes I would, just to change your mind
You've got my love on hold and my heart is on the line

I'm a lonely rider
She's the sole survivor of this love affair
But she don't care
She's a real heartbreaker
And I can't find a taker, no, that can compare
'Cause she's so rare
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

I can still remember
Every time I see her, I go back in time
And lose my mind
Yeah I'm a good pretender
I just can't believe her heart's no longer mine
It's so unkind
She never let me hurt for love
She gave me all she had
But that was only long enough
To go from good to bad

Oh but love don't care whose heart it breaks
It don't care who gets blown away
If it all falls through as a bad mistake
Love don't care whose heart it breaks

No, love don't care whose heart it breaks

1225,Charley Pride,29,Down On The Farm,1985,"

Looking back a hundred years
On daughters and sons of the land
Who're standing here, holding a fistful of dirt
Watching it slip through my hands

See the fields of sweat and tears
Where we labored in love
We cursed the wind and we prayed for rain
But never thought of giving it up

Oh, down on the farm
Oh, somebody's dreams are ending
When a way of life can be auctioned off
There's more than one fence that needs bending

It looks like to me, this country still needs
A muscle and two strong arms
If we can send a man up to the moon
We can keep a man down on the farm

Staring out of this factory window
Trying to make sense of it all
I remember on this very spot, corn standing ten feet tall
America, America, who do we blame it on?
It was only the family fund, who really cares if it's gone

Oh, down on the farm
Oh, somebody's dreams are ending
When a way of life can be auctioned off
There's more than one fence that needs bending

It looks like to me, this country still needs
A muscle and two strong arms
If we can send a man up to the moon
We can keep a man down on the farm
America, America, who do we blame it on?

1226,John Schneider,30,It's A Short Walk From Heaven To Hell,1985,"

You were God's best creation
But I didn't know what I had
Till it was too late
When a man's gettin' older
Seems the young girls get bolder
And temptations
Are sometimes too great
You gave me all kinds of reasons to stay
But like the fool that I am
I still walked away

And it's a short walk
From heaven to hell
A few steps from an angel
That loved me so well
When I left I shook hands
With the devil himself
And it's a short walk
From heaven to hell

She was young
I was foolish
But I needed that young thing
To tell me
I could still turn her on
What I took for affection
Was just your reflection
And that's where
The whole thing went wrong
Cause when the lovin' was over and done
What I took for love
She took for fun

And it's a short walk
From heaven to hell
A few steps from an angel
That loved me so well
When I left I shook hands
With the devil himself
And it's a short walk
From heaven to hell

Yeah, it's a short walk from heaven to hell

1227,David Allan Coe,31,Don't Cry Darlin',1985,"

Drunk
Totally drained
On the verge of going crazy
On the edge of insane
I know you'd prayed I'd make it
But I never pulled through
I gave up on going on girl
Just like I gave up on you

But don't you cry darlin'
Though it's a cryin' shame
I was hooked on that whisky so bad
I didn't know my name when I died
But don't cry darlin'
You know it's not you're fault
I was stealin' time from the devil and I
Just got caught

[Spoken:]
You know Hon
David left you so long ago
He didn't want to darlin
Aw but his dying words told you so
But that strong stuff
Aww, it was always his weakness
But hell, any man can be a fool
And I know that he was so ashamed and sorry
For all those bad things that he did to you

But don't you cry darlin'
Though it's a cryin' shame
I was hooked on that whisky so bad
I didn't know my name when I died
But don't cry darlin'
Well it's not you're fault

1228,Reba McEntire,32,Somebody Should Leave,1985,"

[Verse 1]
It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here in the silence
Putting off what must be said

I read a book
You watch T.V
As our love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me

[Chorus]
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow
We might need each other again

[Verse 2]
You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

If it's only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

[Chorus]

1229,The Bellamy Brothers,33,Old Hippie,1985,"

He turned thirty-five last Sunday
In his hair he found some gray
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle
He likes it better the old way
So he grows a little garden in the back yard by the fence
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense
He get's out there in the twilight zone
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense

He gets off on country music
Cause disco left him cold
He's got young friends into new wave
But he's just too friggin' old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock and the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy and the silence made him cry
Yeah he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why

Cause He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

He was sure back in the sixties that everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam on his senior trip
And they forced him to become a man while he was still a boy
And in each wave of tragedy he waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

Well, he stays away a lot now from the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo...just up and fade away

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

And it won't let our love grow cold

But I know the Lord's been in tougher scrapes then this one
Ain't gonna worry, ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Got no money in the pocket
You don't get rich working overtime
But as long as you can't buy the springtime in Virginia
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna worry
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Love is all that ever makes you richer
Oh well, if the truth be told
Moonlight's been my only silver
And the sunlight's my only gold, mm hmm

So go on wishin', go on prayin'
Go on sayin' I'll hit better times
How in the world could you love me any better?
Ain't gonna worry
I tell ya I ain't gonna worry no, no more
Ain't gonna worry my mind

Well, baby use to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open and that's no lie
The tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now

Well, she used to run around
With every man in town
Spent all my money
A-playin' a high-class game

She put me out
It was a pity how I cried
The tables turnin'
Now it's her turn to cry

Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now

I used to wake up in the mornin'
Get my breakfast in bed
When I gotten worried
She would ease my achin' head

But now she's here and there
With every man in town
Still tryin' to take me
For that same old clown

Because I used to love her
But it's all over now
Because I used to love her
But it's all over now

There are people in this country
Who work hard every day
But mot for fame or fortune do they strive
But the fruits of their labor
Are worth more than their pay
And it's time a few of them were recognized

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello Detroit auto workers
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill worker
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

[Chorus]
This is for the one who swings the hammer
Driving home the nail
Or the one behind the counter
Ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires
The one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes

[Verse 2]
You can see them every morning
In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello West Virginia coal miner
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

[Chorus]
This is for the one who drives the big rig
Up and down the road
Or the one out in the warehouse
Bringing in the load
Or the waitress, the mechanic
The policeman on patrol
For everyone who works behind the scenes
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine

Hello America, let me thank you for your time

I know you're out there somewhere
'Cause I've held you in my dreams
And I'm waitin' for the day it all comes true
So close and yet so far away
You'll be more than just a dream some day
I'll hold you in my arms but 'till I do

I'll get by
I'll wait until the rivers run dry
If it takes a million years girl
I will know a million years can't come too soon
Somehow, somewhere our eyes will meet and then and there
The sparks will set a magic night on fire
And I'll lasso you the moon

I'll know there'll be a lot of little girl left in the lady
While the woman in her will love me all night long
I know one day she'll come to me
Some things are just meant to be
There'll be a place in time where we belong

I'll get by
I'll wait until the rivers run dry
If it takes a million years girl
I will know a million years can't come too soon
Somehow, somewhere our eyes will meet and then and there
The sparks will set a magic night on fire
And I'll lasso you the moon

Girl, we've come a long, long way
Too far for us to end this way
Sometimes the cost of love is hard
And we must pay this little give-and-take

So don't you think if you and I
Were just about and let our hearts decide
Maybe it would all work out in time
So won't you stay, please don't go away

Love, love is what we make it
We can make it so much better if we try
Love, love is what we make it
So let's make it real good this time

Is it too late to change your mind?
Or has it gone to fall this time
Won't you hold me just one more time
Let's just say: ""there's a chance for you and me""

Love, love is what we make it...

And I'm for ""if you don't like it can't you just let it rest.""
And I'm for turning off the music; turning down the lights
'Cause I'm for nothing else but you and me tonight

The cities against the counties
The counties against the state
The state is against the government

As I lay by your side and hold you tonight
I want you to understand
This love that I feel is so right and so real
I realize how lucky I am
And should you ever wonder if my love is true
There's something that I want to make clear to you

There's no way I can make it without you
There's no way that I'd even try
If I had to survive without you in my life
I know I wouldn't last a day
Oh babe, there's no way

It means so much to me whenever I see
That 'wanting me look' in your eyes
I don't know how I could do without
Holding you close every night
I've waited so long just to have you to hold
Now that I've got you
I'll never let go

There's no way I can make it without you
There's no way that I'd even try
If I had to survive without you in my life
I know I wouldn't last a day
Oh babe, there's no way

I never knew until you
What I was missing
Now you say ""Forever.""
I find my heart, it's listening
Yes, I'm listening

There's no way I can make it without you
There's no way that I'd even try
If I had to survive without you in my life

Oh babe, there's no way

Baby, there's just no way

1238,Highwaymen,42,Highwayman,1985,"

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

[Verse 2: Kris Kristofferson]
I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

[Verse 3: Waylon Jennings]
I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around and around and around and
Around and around

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
I fly a star-ship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again

You know I'm a lifetime guarantee
So if they ask you what you mean to me

Don't call it love, Heavens above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Go on and tell them baby

Nobody believes we got something they haven't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are

Don't call it love, Heavens above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Go ahead and tell them baby

Feels so good holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right, no, no, no

Don't call it love, Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love because that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything

Don't call it love, Heaven's above

Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
The only home you know is that bar down the street

Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man

Drinking and dancing, to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go run and have your fun, you think you played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart

1243,Jimmy Buffett,47,Who's The Blond Stranger?,1985,"

Nothin' like this way out in West Texas
Galveston Bay is a whole other world
My wife's in our room gettin' over her sunburn
How would Louis L'Amour get me next to that girl

She tells me her tan is the same all over
She asks me to dance and says, ""Keep your boots on.""
She never met a number one cowboy
We rolled in the sand and drank rum until dawn

Who's the blonde stranger, who entered my life
Makin' me over, in the moonlight
This side of Texas, is all new to me
Who's the blonde stranger, who lives by the sea

Stayed up all night and for me that's the first time
Sneak in the room just as cool as I can
Pull back the sheets and the bed is all empty
Except for a note left from some guy named Dan

My head got all light and the room started spinning
I stepped outside just to get some fresh air
Out on a wave was my own darlin' Lola
And some pretty boy with bleach in his hair

Who's the blonde stranger, out there with my wife
What were they doin', in the moonlight
This side of Texas, is all new to me
Who are these strangers, who live by the sea

Back on the ranch and everything's normal
Beach blanket bingo comes on the TV
We talk in our sleep and then the next morning
I ask her who's Dan and she says who's Marie?

Who's the blonde stranger, who entered my life
Makin' me over, in the moonlight
This side of Texas, is all new to me
Who's the blonde stranger, lives by the sea

Who's the blonde stranger, who entered my life
Makin' me over, in the moonlight

1244,The Judds,48,Girls Night Out,1985,"

[Verse 1:]
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight ain't nothing gonna slow me down

I did my time working all week
Tonight's all mine
Tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound

Well, I've been couped up
All week long
I've been working my fingers to the bone

[Chorus:]
Well, it's a girls' night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance
'Til the boys go home

Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt
Lordy, it's a girls' night out

[Verse 2:]
Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe
They can play 'em fast
Or they can play 'em slow
I can do 'em all just show me the floor

You can give me a little rock 'n roll
Or even a waltz with the lights down low
I'll still be dancing
When they close the door

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

1245,Anne Murray,49,I Don't Think I'm Ready For You,1985,"

I've never been scared of love before now
But I've never been this much in love
With you it happened so fast that I'm afraid it won't last
And I don't wanna lose what my dreams are made of

I don't think I'm ready for you
There are too many heartaches I've already been through
But this feeling inside is getting harder to hide
Until I know that you feel it too
I don't think I'm ready for you

Right on the edge of out of control
Trying hard not to let what's in my heart show
One of your kisses, my will to resist is all gone
Cos I love you, but baby I know

I don't think I'm ready for you
One heart on the line's not enough, it takes two
And it wouldn't take much
Just three words with that touch of yours
To tell me, but until you do
I don't think I'm ready for you

And it wouldn't take much
Just three words with that touch of yours
To tell me, but until you do
I don't think I'm ready for you
I don't think I'm ready for you

1246,Dolly Parton (Duet With Kenny Rogers),50,Real Love,1985,
1247,Reba McEntire,1,Whoever's In New England,1986,"

You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there

You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I've packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again
There's just one thing you ought to know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

1248,Ronnie Milsap,2,Happy  Happy Birthday Baby,1986,"

Happy, happy, birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you

Happy, happy, birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget

'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty, I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too

Happy, happy birthday baby
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty..I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So, I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too

Happy, happy, birthday baby...

[Verse 1]
Sun is up, time's at hand
There's a stir across the land
And so begins another day
On life's highway

[Verse 2]
On city streets, down country roads
Like a stream the people flow
There's bread to win and tolls to pay
On life's highway

[Chorus]
There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build, a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray
On life's highway

[Verse 3]
We are young, then we're old
Passing through, then passing on
Like the roses bloom and fade
On life's highway

[Verse 4]
Step by step, 'round and 'round
Never knowing where we're bound
From the cradle to the grave
On life's highway

[Chorus]
There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build, a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray
On life's highway

Sun is up, time's at hand

1250,The Forester Sisters,4,Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes,1986,"

Mama says I shouldn't be going with you
Mama says she knows best
You'll take my heart and break it in two
'Cause you're just like all the rest
She says that you're just a one-night man
And you'll end up hurting me
Aw, but I've seen something that Mama ain't ever seen

Mama's never looked into those eyes
Felt the way that they hypnotize
She don't know how they make me feel inside
If Mama ever knew what they do to me
I think she'd be surprised
Aw, but Mama's never seen those eyes
Mama's never seen those eyes

Mama says that I shouldn't let you steal a kiss
Mama says it just ain't right
She don't know that I can't resist
With the moon so big and bright
She says I'll find a love some day
But you're just not the one
Aw, I've done something that Mama ain't ever done

Mama's never looked into those eyes
Felt the way that they hypnotize
She don't know how they make me feel inside
If Mama ever knew what they do to me
I think she'd be surprised
Aw, but Mama's never seen those eyes
Mama's never seen those eyes

Mama's never looked into those eyes
Felt the way that they hypnotize
She don't know how they make me feel inside
If Mama ever knew what they do to me
I think she'd be surprised
Aw, but Mama's never seen those eyes

1251,Dwight Yoakam,5,Honky Tonk Man,1986,"

Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well I can't wait to see the lights of town

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well, I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
Well I can't wait to lay my money down

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing

"
1252,Kenny Rogers,6,Tomb Of The Unknown Love,1986,"

One time I drove to see a girl across the country
One night as I was driving through New Mexico
I had the windows wide open
It was cold and I was crying
And I laid her letter on the radio
Then I stopped outside of Tahoe
Thru this tiny mining town
At a diner to refill for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying
Like a heart broke right in two
I turned my collar up and went inside

Well, I saw this smiling waitress
Joshing friendly with these truckers
They'd give her pats and she'd give them shoves
I said: ""Miss what's that awful crying?""
Everybody laughed and said:
""It's the tomb of the unknown love""
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And on that winter night
I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still, it said:

Here lies a young man struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand this true love cheating
So he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up (right) above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying
From the tomb of the unknown love

So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came
I didn't even try to fight
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning
Warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, then they'll put the shackles on me
And we'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me 'cos it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me up a stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and read along
These words that will give them a chill
And it'll say:

Here lies a young man

1253,Eddie Rabbitt,7,Repetitive Regret,1986,"

I hear she got a new last name last week
Nobody I can blame but me
One too many nights, one too many lonely nights was all that she could take
While I was runnin around, she was walking away, my oh my

Repetitive regret is that I left
The girl I can't forget go, my oh my
Repetitive regret is that I bet
She ain't alone, and I'm alone

Never been so alone in so long
Oh now I know I ain't so strong
One too many queens, One too many selfish dreams were taking me away
From all I love, now all I can say

Repetitive regret is that I left
The girl I can't forget go, my oh my
Repetitive regret is that I bet
She ain't alone, and I'm alone

One too many nights, one too many lonely nights was all that she could take
While I was runnin around she was walking away, my oh my

Repetitive regret is that I left
The girl I can't forget go, my oh my
Repetitive regret is that I bet
She ain't alone, and I'm alone

My repetitive regret
My repe-e-titive regret
My repet-t-t-titive regret
Is that I let
My repetitive regret
My repe-e-titive regret
My repet-t-t-titive regret
I let her go
My repetitive regret

[Verse 1]
Give us your tired and weak
And we will make them strong
Bring us your foreign songs
And we will sing along
Leave us your broken dreams
We'll give them time to mend
There's still a lot of love
Living in the Promiseland

[Chorus]
Living in the Promiseland
Our dreams are made of steel
The prayer of every man
Is to know how freedom feels
There is a winding road
Across the shifting sand
And room for everyone
Living in the Promiseland

[Verse 2]
So they came from a distant isle
Nameless woman
Faithless child, like a bad dream
Until there was no room at all
No place to run, and no place to fall
Give us our daily bread
We have no shoes to wear
No place to call our home
Only this cross to bear
We are the multitudes
Lend us a helping hand
Is there no love anymore
Living in the Promiseland

[Chorus]
Living in the Promiseland
Our dreams are made of steel
The prayer of every man
Is to know how freedom feels
There is a winding road
Across the shifting sand
And room for everyone
Living in the Promiseland

1255,Tanya Tucker,9,One Love At A Time,1986,"

It makes me weak
And in a hurry
All night long I lay
And I worry
I'm so afraid I'm gonna talk in my sleep
Who do I love
Who am I using
Which one is which can get so confusing
I've got to chose one and set the other one free

One love at a time thats all I can handle
Burning both ends of the candle can drive you insane
With one love in your heart
And one love on your mind
It can tear a girl apart
I just need one love at a time

Ones got a birthday
Its in December
Which ones in July
I can't remember
I get em mixed up
What am I gonna do
It keeps me uptight
Driving me crazy
They're both believing
They're both my baby
Sometimes I wonder
Whos been playing with who

One love at a time thats all I can handle
Burning both ends of the candle can drive you insane
With one love in your heart
And one love on your mind
It can tear a girl apart
I just need one love at a time
Yes it can tear this girl apart
I just need one love at a time

1256,Dan Seals,10,Everything That Glitters (Is Not Gold),1986,"

[Verse 1]
Saw your picture on a poster in a cafe out in Phoenix
Guess you're still the sweetheart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home
And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind

[Chorus]
But, oh, sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh, the crowd will always love you
But, as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

[Verse 2]
Well, old Red, he's getting older
And last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey, she's still growing
And she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know
Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all

[Chorus]
But then sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh, the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

[Bridge]
Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure your gonna know the cost
'Cause for everything you win, there's something lost

[Chorus]
But, oh, sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh, the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Everything that glitters is not gold

1257,Restless Heart,11,Til I Loved You,1986,"

Til I loved you
I didn't know the meaning of the word
I was only takin'
Giving nothing in return
My life was an empty page
Less than an even trade

Til I loved you
My heart was an island unto itself
I thought I needed no one
Til I looked into your eyes
I knew it all right then
I saw what a fool I'd been

Til I loved you (til I loved you)
I didn't know what I was missin'
Til I loved you
Taught me that dreamers don't need wings to fly

Til I loved you
I had never tasted tears of joy
When I take you in my arms
There's no doubt in my mind
This is where I belong
The loneliness is gone
I was livin' my life all wrong
Til I loved you

"
1258,Marie Osmond,12,Read My Lips,1986,"

Sometimes I can be so shy
I keep my emotions deep inside
And I try to tell you how much you mean to me
But each time I start out I get stuck
Words don't come easily

When the feel of my hand
And the warmth of my touch ain't enough
Don't give up
Read my lips
If your heart doesn't hear
When my arms draw you near
It will soon, soon be clear
Read my lips

Loving eyes gaze into mine
Looking for some kind of sign if I were a poet
My feelings were poetry
I'd send you a thousand lines
About how much you mean to me

When the feel of my hand
And the warmth of my touch ain't enough
Don't give up
Read my lips
If your heart doesn't hear
When my arms draw you near
It will soon, soon be clear
Read my lips

Time after time
I try my best to say
How much I need you, darling
The words just never came

When the feel of my hand
And the warmth of my touch ain't enough
Don't give up
Read my lips
If your heart doesn't hear
When my arms draw you near
It will soon, soon be clear
Read my lips

Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool
That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye

Everytime we disagreed
She was always askin' me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone
She probably thinks I'm home
Just a mopin' around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing
I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer
As long as these bottles hold out

Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool
That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye

Every time I try to sit down and talk to her
It always ends up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up to the time
She got on that Greyhound bus
It would be better if I could forget her
'Cause she sure forgot about me
And if takes all night I'm gonna' do it right
I'm gonna' sit here till I can't see

Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool
That's what I'm a-doin' today
Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin'
I'm a boozin' my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one

I guess, I should accept the call
But I really don't know what to say
The operator won't let you talk at all
And she said, ""You want me to pay?""

Oh, well it ain't nothin' new
It fits right with my picture of you
But tonight, you're gonna find out
What these tears are all about

'Cause this old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know, what I'm talkin' about
This old flame went out

You went to get cigarettes
That was last July, you didn't get home yet
And now you expect me to hear you out
You call me collect, there ain't no doubt

This old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know, what I'm talkin' about
This old flame went out

What do you mean, how can I do this to you?
Let's not forget who walked out on who

This old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know, what I'm talkin' about
This old flame went out

Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough
Tryin' hard don't always make it easy
'Cause hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

Lately all I do is think about you
It's weighin' like a stone inside my mind
I know I've taken you for granted
And left your heart hangin' on the line

Oh it tears me up when you go all to pieces
Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough
Tryin' hard don't always make it easy
'Cause hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

Your love is finally gettin' to me
I can't believe the things I've done
And still you're standin' here beside me
The fool and the faithful one

Oh it tears me up when you go all to pieces
Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough

If you want to know how far we can go, you got to hold on
If you take it slow then I got something to show you, baby, hold on
All those girls with their empty heads
Can't fill 'em up with the lies they've been fed
If you want to know how far I can go, you got to hold on

She'll give you reasons for her kind
You might believe it, but I'm not that blind

If you think you need a woman like me, you got to hold on
If you want to find what I've got on my mind, baby, hold on
All this small talk that keeps us apart
Is only hiding how we feel in our hearts
If you think you need a woman like me, you got to hold on

Full of old heirlooms
Grandma's Bible, Grandpa's trunk
To a total stranger no more than junk
The closest ties I ever knew
Until I met you

There's a barn on my father's farm
Built with hardwood beams
Sewn by hand to stand the test of time
Cedar dowel pins in Southern pine
The closest thing to strength I knew
Until I met you

Now the stars don't shine the same
Everything's in a state of change
Twilight I never knew
Until I met you

There's a part of my father's heart
That belongs to only one
He told me so a long time ago
Fall in love, then you'll know
The closest thing to God I knew
Until I met you

Now the stars don't shine the same
Everything's in a state of change
Twilight I never knew
Until I met you
Until I met you
Until I met you

If it was up to the boss, I think he'd work you to death
We got bills to pay and we're up to our necks in debt
I went to pick up the truck, the radiator still leaks
Sometimes it feels like we're stuck with no paddle up a creek

Baby when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through

Well the price of groceries goes up every day
Seems like our hard-earned money just up and flies away
Sometimes it feels like we're backed in a corner up against the wall
But puttin' up with the hassles isn't really a hassle at all, 'cause...

Baby when it's down to me and you
We leave our worries at the door
We got more important things to do
Baby when it's down to me and you
We just make up for life's little problems
By makin' love the whole night through

We'll lock the world outside
Oh we've made up our minds
Love is all that matters tonight

Baby when it's down to me and you

Baby when it's down to me and you

Rita was 16 years
Hazel eyes and chestnut hair

He kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene
Lost a child in Tennessee
Oh, and still that love survived

'Cause they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

One of the boys in Eddie's band
Took a shine to Rita's hand
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh, but he was back by June
Singing a different tune
And sporting Miss Rita back by his side

And he sang
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Eddie traveled with the barroom band
Till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
And Rita's got a house to keep
Dime store novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night

And they sing
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little to closer me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little to closer me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

1270,Randy Travis,24,On The Other Hand,1986,"

[Verse 1]
On one hand I count the reasons, I could stay with you
And hold you close to me, all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong

[Chorus]
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

[Verse 2]
In your arms I feel the passions, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

[Chorus]
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

[Outro]
Yeah the reason I must go, is on the other hand

[Chorus: T. Graham Brown]
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
And in between the sorrow at least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

[Verse 1: T. Graham Brown]
Oh I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always lose and you would win
Times you would desert me how the emptiness would hurt me
But your coming back was always worth the pain
Lord I wish that I could hurt that way again

[Verse 2: T. Graham Brown]
I'd love to hear you tell me you don't need me anymore
Just like you used to tell me every day
And I'd love to watch you leaving like a hundred times before
At least my eyes could see you walk away

[Chorus: T. Graham Brown]
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
In between the sorrow at least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow there's no end
Oh I wish that I could hurt that way again

No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

Now I know for certain, you're the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', just you I'm dreamin' of
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner, in a corner
Don't go no where, why do I care?
Your kisses are worth waiting for, believe me

I don't stay out late, I don't care to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner, in a corner
Don't go nowhere, why do I care?
Your kisses are worth waiting for, believe me

(Arthur Leo Owens - Dennis Knutson)
Somebody keeps paying my bar tab
But the bartender won't tell me who
He gives me six cold ones, to go when he closes
And slips me a dollar or two
My woman is keeping me busy
And I'm afraid to go ask her why
But the more I keep drinking
The more I keep thinking
There's somebody new in her life
Chorus:
Somebody wants me out of the way
And I bet I'll find out when I go home today
Here comes the waitress with a loaded down tray
Somebody wants me out of the way
Now my woman is under suspicion
And all I can see in my mind
It's two cheating lovers who love under cover
And the covers they're under is mine
Chorus:
Somebody wants me out of the way
And I bet I'll find out when I go home today
Here come the waitress with a loaded down tray
Somebody wants me out of the way
Somebody wants me out of the way....

Going to tie our love in a double knot
Because these days love gets strained a lot
To give our hearts a double shot
Let's tie our love in a double knot

[Verse 1]
Whoa, if we want to endure
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
While we're wrapped up in those ties that bind
I want to make sure we don't unwind

[Chorus]
So we'll tie our love in a double knot
Because these days love gets strained a lot
To give our hearts a double shot
Let's tie our love in a double knot

[Verse 2]
Because I've got my dreams, baby, you got yours
Put it together, we got a whole lot more
Because I ain't looking for just one night
No, I want to make it the rest of our lives

[Chorus]
So let's tie our love in a double knot
Because these days love gets strained a lot
To give our hearts a double shot
Let's tie our love in a double knot

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Tie our love in a double knot
Because these days love gets strained a lot
To give our hearts a double shot

Tie our love in a double knot
Let's tie our love in a double knot
Tie our love in a double knot

I want to thank you for your call
I truly do
And if you leave your number
I'll try to get back to you
But right now I'm a little busy
And I just can't take the time
Cause there's somebody with me
And I really hate to waste your dime

Cause I'm all tied up
Tied up, baby
Tied up, tied up baby
Something's got a hold on me

All tied up
Tied up, baby
I don't want to be set free
All tied up
Tied up, baby

Tied up
Tied up, baby
Tied up
Tied up, baby
Tied up in love

I'm sorry
But I can't see you anymore
Cause I don't feel the way I did
When you walked out the door
That's filling up my mind
She's lying here beside me
So I better get off the line

Cause I'm all tied up
Tied up, baby
Tied up, tied up, baby
Something's got a hold on me

All tied up, tied up baby
I don't want to be set free
All tied up

Tied up in love

She put the magic in my heart
Houdini couldn't pull us part

1278,Michael Johnson,32,Gotta Learn To Love Without You,1986,"

Gotta hold my pillow real tight till the midnight hour ends
Gotta lean on a friend sometime when your memories begin
Gotta live without, forget about your love and then

I gotta learn to love without you
Get the feeling back and my heart on the track of love without you
It'll take a little time to mend
Gotta learn to love without you, somebody teach me how to
And lift me up so I can fall again

Don't need any telephone call when you think you've changed your mind
Don't tempt me again, I've given in one too many times
Gotta grow back strong, leave you a long, long way behind

I gotta learn to love without you
Get the feeling back and my heart on the track of love without you
It'll take a little time to mend
Gotta learn to love without you, someone teach me how to
Lift me up so I can fall again

Now I don't need someone for new inspiration
And I don't need a strong drink or two
No soft lights, music, or warm conversation
There's no substitution for you
Cause I've got all that I need to be happy
Cause your love makes everything right
You're the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And you're the last thing I needed tonight

You're the last thing I needed
You always are
I can't wait for the day to end
You're the last thing I needed
To hold in my arms
If I should never wake up again

Now I always find you
Somewhere in my dreams
And I know when I close my eyes
You'll be the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And the last thing I needed tonight

You're the first thing that I'll need tomorrow
And you're the last thing I needed tonight

Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This world's gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
Where the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days

Musical interlude

Grandpa
Everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wonder back into the past
And paint me a picture of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days

Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good ole days

I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
To that old flame that burns inside of me
She cried when I left her, now I try to forget her
Oh, how foolish I was to ever want to leave

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody in his right mind would've left her
I had to be crazy to say goodbye
Nobody in his right mind would've left her
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

[Verse 2]
I still carry her picture; I wish her well
With the new love I know she's found by now
Each night finds me dreaming, each day I spend thinking
How much I wish she was still around

Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

She has got the moves but she don't go too far

Start her up and she don't stop

Heads are turnin' 'round

But the boys all gather 'round

When she's hoppin'
She keeps poppin'
Can't quit rockin'
Ain't no stoppin' now, uh huh

Makes us crazy 'round the clock

1283,The Everly Brothers,37,Born Yesterday,1986,"

Living in the city where the walls have ears
People judge you by the words they hear
Shake their heads while they chew your name
And then they write it on a wall
People see you and they turn their heads
Whisper words you might have said
Point to a spot where you may have bled
Then they write it on a wall
He lost his mind today
She threw his clothes away
The love they thought would last just flew away
She lost her mind today
He threw her ring away
They act as if they were born yesterday
And I wonder whose heart hurts the worst
And who knows whose heart was broke first
No one gives them the love they need
Or helps them through their time of grief
After all, it could be you or me
We're just human after all
He lost his mind today
She threw his clothes away
The love they thought would last just flew away
She lost her mind today
He threw her ring away
They act as if they were born yesterday
And I wonder whose heart hurts the worst
And who knows whose heart was broke first
They lost their minds today
They threw their love away
They act as if they were born yesterday
They lost their love today
They threw it all away
They act as if they were born yesterday

Lookin' up at the hymnal in my Mamma and Daddy's hand
Though they were singin' different notes, somehow they made them blend
I don't re-member the sermon, the only thing I recall
Was listnin' to my Mom and Dad make the sweetest sound of all

Harmo-ny, harmony
It touches somethin' down at your very core
There's somethin' 'bout the sound, the voices in accord
Singin' harmo-ny

Fell in love with the music and I learned the music of love
Got the rhythm of a giving heart, everything but giving up
Start with the strong foun- dation, adding a part at a time
Lift up your voice, make a joyfull noise and a little piece of mind

Harmo-ny, harmony
It touches somethin' down at your very core
There's somethin' 'bout the sound, the voices in accord
Singin' harmo-ny

No matter what you're doin', no matter where you are
There's somethin' 'bout the sound, of voices in accord
It's gentle as a breeze, stronger than the soul
There's somethin' 'bout the sound, of voices in accord
Singin' harmony, harmo-ny

Listen to the light rain
Beating on the tin roof

Moving to and fro
Just swaying
Like a slow freight train
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Rocking with the rhythm of the rain
That's a fallin'
Night birds a singing
The cricket a calling

Oh, feels so fine

Nights like this
Come once in a lifetime
Me and my baby
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Hold me tight say
Say you love me

Just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

To think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun

Because today I started loving you again

Then today I started loving you again

Through the chill of winter
Running across a frozen lake
Hunters hard right on his trail
All odds are against him
With a family to provide for
But one thing he must keep alive

[Chorus:]
Will the wolf survive?[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Drifting by the roadside
Climbs a strong and aging face
Wants to make some honest pay
Losing to the rainstorm
He's got two strong legs to guide him
Two strong arms keep him alive
Will the wolf survive?
Standing in the pouring rain
All alone in a world that's changed
Running scared now forced to hide
In a land where he once stood with pride
But he'll find his way by the morning light
Sounds across the nation
Coming from your hearts and minds
Battered drums and old guitar
Singing songs of passion
It's the truth that they all look for
Something they must keep alive

[Chorus:]
Will the wolf survive?[x3]

1297,The Oak Ridge Boys,1,It Takes A Little Rain,1987,"

Sometimes we're friends
Sometimes we're strangers
And though there are tears
There's always love
It hurts when you cry
From words thrown in anger
Warm feelings run deep
But that's not enough

It takes a little rain
To make love grow
It's the heartache and the pain
That makes the real heart show
Where the sun always shines
There's a desert below
It takes a little rain
To make love grow

Hearts disagree
Then they grow closer
Honesty wins
When it's someone you trust
Forever takes time
True love is never over
It's filled with new starts
Just look at us

It takes a little rain
To make love grow
It's the heartache and the pain
That makes the real heart show
Where the sun always shines
There's a desert below
It takes a little rain
To make love grow

How it must have hurt you, Julia
Waitin' for your love to be returned
I never knew how
What can I do now that I
Have finally learned?

I never thought that love could hurt me
Now I tremble at the thought of losing you
And all the perfect words desert me now

Won't you let me hold you one more time?
The music is over
But I'll hold you closer this time, Julia

We have known each other for us long
We are most like one
And the ties of our love are so strong
They could never be undone

But if you should ever get restless
Just remember where ever you go

In every smile, every face
Any time, any place
I will be there
Like a light in the dark
When you look in your heart
You'll stop and stare
And I will be there

There are times when you may get lonely
Feeling lost on your own
But if there's one thing this love has shown me
We are never alone
And no matter how far away you are
My love follows you

In every smile, every face
Any time, any place
I will be there
Like a light in the dark
When you look in your heart
You'll stop and stare
And I will be there

On a cold night, in the moonlight
When you're dreamin', and when you rise in the sunrise
Baby, I swear I will be there
Cause no matter how far away you are
My love follows you

In every smile, every face
Any time, any place
I will be there
Like a light in the dark
When you look in your heart
You'll stop and stare
And I will be there

I will be there, any time, I will be there

On a cold night, in the moonlight and when you rise, in the sunrise
Baby I will be there

Cruising in my station wagon
Trying to keep my muffler from dragging
Sometimes it seems so defeating
As I'm hustling to make it to the cub scout meeting

I dream about Mexico
Where all the pretty people go
But we're on a budget that just won't budge
Not much money but a whole lot of love

Living that domestic life
Happy children and a pretty wife
Our cocker spaniel's always having puppies
How could anybody be so lucky?

See me mowing my domestic yard
Lord, I owe my soul to Master Card
But it seems to suit me to a tee
That domestic life's all right with me

Our neighbor's names are Fred and Ruth
He wears a lot of leisure suits
She sells Avon and Tupperware too
We're always ducking all the bull they shoot

I'll never be president
And we never seem to save a cent
But things are looking better everyday
Hell I'm Sergeant At Arms of the P.T.A

Living that domestic life
Happy children and a pretty wife
Our cocker spaniel's always having puppies
How could anybody be so lucky?

See me mowing my domestic yard

But too much waters run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you

Theres too many rivers to cross, dear
Too many dreams have been lost
And theres too many long nights that I’ve turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross

Now dont think for a moment
I blame only you
We both peeled the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces that you can’t find

And there's too many dreams that have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross

Gotta a preacher waiting and that's how it's gonna be
Cause baby's got a hold on me
Got a hold on
Got a hold on me
Got a hold on
Baby's gotta hold on me
Gotta hold on x3
Baby's gotta hold on me x3

1304,Randy Travis,8,Forever And Ever  Amen,1987,"

You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love, that I feel for you, always will be

You're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die – oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, Amen

They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway

They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you – oh, darling

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever, Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, Amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever, Amen

I've had girls and I've had women
You weren't the first
You probably won't be the last
But lady, after last night's lovin'
I'll bet my soul, you're the best

You put your lips where they belong
You brought the love for my secret dreams
I've been held but never touched
You touch me now, I'll never be the same

Baby, I'll be coming back for more
Some night you'll find me at your door
You know just what a body's for
Now other loves just leave me bored

Last night you took away my breath
And babe, I still ain't found it yet
So you can know one thing's for sure
I'll be coming back for more

I know people stand between us
Someone loves me, someone loves you
But baby, now I've tasted heaven
There's nothin' else that I can do

Baby, I'll be coming back for more
Some night you'll find me at your door
You know just what a body's for
Now other loves just leave me bored

Last night you took away my breath
And babe, I ain't found it yet

Well you can call out the sheriff and the highway patrol
Cause there's a fool on the road careenin' out of control
Hard liquor fast women I just can't let 'em be
Lord I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Well I keep my motor runnin' got my beer on the ice
And my idea of heaven is a pair of dice
Seven come on eight set this poor boy free
Lord I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Bright lights Saturday night I had a couple and I'm feeling alright
My cupcake she can wiggle and shake spend more money than anybody make

So give me a shot of that octane juice
You know where ain't no cure for the honky tonk blues
And if they come up with somethin' I'll develop an immunity
And I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me

Out on the town just a foolin' around
Hey I got my mind on the lost and found
Step up no need to be shy
All right pretty women you got the ticket to ride

When my tires are flat and I'm out of gas
I promise myself I'll let the next one pass
Lord I wish that a promise didn't break so easily
And I wish hard livin' didn't come easy for me

And I never thought I'd want it back

So I played it smart
That was a close one
But I kept my cool never let down my guard
That was a close one

The winter of '79 was so cold and lonely I found a good woman she took me inside
And I swear to God I really tried
And that was a close one

Will there ever be a love of my life when I'm out of my pride And out of my mind in the nick of time
And when the feeling in here is fine
That's the close ones

That was a close one

Somehow I knew I'd see you tonight
Here in our old rendezvous
I'm at the mercy of old memories
You've got your somebody new

You may wonder why I keep coming by
With this heart so broken in two
Any fool can see with one look at me
That it's only over for you

It's only over for you
No, I'm not the one you found somebody new
You can go on believing we're through
Ooh, but it's only over, it's only over for you

As I watch you falling in love
You can't see me falling apart
And even though you hurt me I know
I still love you with all of my heart

But I won't hide my face in a stranger's embrace
When we dance into each other's view
No, don't be surprised at these tears in my eyes
'Cause it's only over for you

It's only over for you
No, I'm not the one you found somebody new
You can go on believing we're through
Ooh, but it's only over, it's only over for you
Oh, it's only over, it's only over for you

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And therefor I reside in Tennessee

Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee

I been losin’ my mind one lover at a time
Getting up just to be knocked down
But with all of that pain I come back again
And I always go one more round
Women, me, and love we just can’t get it right
Well I may lose the battle but I love the fight

Well love you ain’t seen the last of me
I just keep comin’ back to see
If I can capture the dream
Love you’ve done all you can do to me
I don’t give up so easily
No you ain’t seen the last of me

I got a big long list of all the times I missed
When I zeroed in on love
And at times it seems
Like one heartache begins
Where the last one has just left off
And tonight it looks like
Another one is aimed at my heart
But she’s a lookin’ at me and
I’m feelin’ that feelin’ start

No love you ain’t seen the last of me
I just keep comin’ back to see
If I can capture the dream
Oh love you’ve done all you can do to me
I don’t give up so easily
No you ain’t seen the last of me

I said tonight it looks like
Another one is aimed at my heart
Cause she’s a lookin’ at me and
I’m feelin’ that feelin’ start

No love you ain’t seen the last of me

If I can capture the dream
Yeah love you’ve done
All you can do to me
I don’t give up easily
And no you ain’t seen the last of me

I've always seen myself as a reckless gambler
Risking all that I had
Whenever I could

But then one day it happened
You appeared like from a dream
And we moved in synch like dancing
With our hearts in harmony

You are my way
To another world
Your are the one who makes me fly so high
You are the rain when my spirits run dry
You give my life
A hope that's real

'Cause when I'm with you
You take me away
To another world

All my life I've been called a hopeless romantic
Waiting for my prince
To sweep me away
But when I found you I felt different
Than I ever felt before
Suddenly I was taking no chances
By walking through your door

You are my way
To another world
Your are the one who makes me fly so high
You are the rain when my spirits run dry
You give my life
A hope that's real

A couple of days isn't a very long time
Why can't I just walk away
I used to be good at goodbye
But out on the water
Under the stars
I let the moonlight play a trick on my heart

[Chorus]
You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

[Verse 2]
The radio plays, the sound of the waves rollin' in
The smell of the night
Sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment
I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

How much can happen in a night or two?
I guess it's all depending on your point of view

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life

Caught you looking at my baby
Out of the corner of my eye
We were arm in arm
When you smiled at him as we went walking by

Now I understand what could make a girl
Try a little trick like that
But if you're thinking of trying to win his love
Let me tell you where it's at

Everybody's crazy 'bout my baby
But my baby's crazy 'bout me
Everybody's got eyes for my baby
But I'm the only one he sees

So give him a smile
And try to get his attention
The one thing, girl
I'd like to mention
Everybody's crazy 'bout my baby
And my baby's crazy 'bout me

We go walking down the avenue
He's dressed up and looking fine
I can hear hearts break
Cause I know just what all you pretty girls have got in mind

You smile in my face
But you'd take my place
The minute my back was turned
So before you try to steal my guy
Let me tell you something that I have learned

Everybody's crazy 'bout my baby
But my baby's crazy 'bout me
Everybody's got eyes for my baby
But I'm the only one he sees

She had a ragtop El Dorado tuck and roll pleat
She picked me up in Colorado
And put me right in the driver's seat
I said, I got no money
You know, I got no job
She said, I tell you what, honey
Let's find a place to rob

Now, the man at the station's name was Jim
I saw it sewed on his shirt
I told him, do what I say
You'll live another day
Nobody's gotta get hurt

It was the crime of passion
She took me by the heart when she took me by the hand
Crime of passion
A beautiful woman and a desperate man

Well, I thought the thing was over
She was countin' the cash
When an unmarked Chevy Nova
Made the blue lights flash

She said, officer, won't you help me, please
I looked at her and she was pointin' at me
You see, Jim at the station played the part
And I talked a little perjury
He went to great pains to leave out her name
He was her future ex-husband, can't you see

It was the crime of passion
She took me by the heart when she took me by the hand
Crime of passion
A beautiful woman and a desperate man

Now, the man at the station's name was Joe
I saw it on the badge on his shirt
He said, you'll never get away
But do what we say
Nobody has to get hurt

It was the crime of passion
She took me by the heart when she took me by the hand
Crime of passion
A beautiful woman and a desperate man

Crime of passion
She took me by the heart when she took me by the hand
Crime of passion
A beautiful woman and a desperate man

It was the crime of passion
It's just a crime of passion

Your every wish was my command
And my heart tells me
I must forget
I loved you then
I'll love you yet

These hands, you can hold 'em all night if you want to
And these lips won't mind your kisses, no they don't care
You can lay your head on my shoulder
Maybe even get a little bolder
But when it comes to my heart, don't touch me there

These arms, you can wrap 'em 'round you gently
Your fingers, you can run 'em through my hair
But there's one place that's off balance
From the last time love came 'round
When it comes to my heart, don't touch me there

Last time I gave my heart so sweetly it broke
He broke it so completely that even now it's more than I can bear
Now someday I know I'll try again, someday but until then
When it comes to my heart, don't touch me there

These hands, you can hold 'em all night if you want to
And these lips won't mind your kisses, no they don't care

Maybe even get a little bolder

""Beyond the law, anything goes
""When you're livin' on the edge of Mexico.""

But I didn't believe
Not till I tried to keep him close to me

He rode away in a cloud of dust
Chasin' Laredo and Lady Luck
His bags were full of who knows what?
I knew what I had to do
Girls ride horses too

I rode all day
Tracking him down
Spent the night on dangerous ground
Smelling the smoke of the distant fire
Feeling the flame of my desires
Well, nothing in the desert is what it seems
I ran up numbers in my dreams

He rode away in a cloud of dust
Chasin' Laredo and Lady Luck
His bags were full of who knows what?
I knew what I had to do
Girls ride horses too

I crossed the river as the sun came up
Drank his Tequila from a silver cup
Traded his bags for a sack of gold
And got a little taste of Mexico
If he's gonna love me, he's gotta get tough
Life on the border is a little bit rough

He rode away in a cloud of dust
Chasin' Laredo and Lady Luck
His bags were full of who knows what?
I did what I had to do

Oh, he rode away in a cloud of dust

And we've sworn we'd never do that again

Oh we burned our bras and we burned our dinners
And we burned our candles at both ends

Who look just like the way we did back then
Oh but we're all grown up now, all grown up

I'll do anything
To get back again

Oh, I had it (I had it)
Oh, but I've lost it (I lost it)
Now I've got a broken heart to mend (heart to mend)
Baby listen, I don't care what the cost is
I've got to find my way back in

So you just snap your fingers
And baby I'll come runnin'
I'll do anything
To get back again, yeah!...

"
1332,The Bellamy Brothers,36,Country Rap,1987,"

[Verse 1]
Hillbillies talkin' 'bout turnip greens
Cornbread, sweetpatatos, pork and beans
Country roads farm and ranch
Drink a little creek water from the branch
We got pickup trucks chicken clucks
Happy even when we're down on our luck
We got fatback that's a fact
And if you don't know that's a country rap

[Verse 2]
Neighbor down the roads got a cow for sale
Twenty dollars more you get the horns and tail
Saturday night we're goanna go get drunk
Something in the road smells like a skunk
Steel guitars rowdy bars
Redneck girls and beat-up cars
We got fatback that's a fact
And if you don't know that's a country rap

[Verse 3]
Sunday morning catch a speckled perch
Been bad all week I got to go to church
That afternoon it's all you please
Fried chicken mash patatas black-eyed peas
Bumper sticker says lets rodeo
Find me a hunny say hay lets go
We got fatback that's a fact
And if you don't know that's a country rap

[Verse 4]
Cowboy's talking about his quarter horse
Pig farmers talking bout his pigs of course
Sheeps and goats calf ropein' daughter
How his son sings cool cool water
Alligator crawling round way down south
Turn me around shut my mouth
We got fatback that's a fact
And if you don't know that's a country rap

And if you don't know that's a country rap

1333,Vince Gill,37,Cinderella,1987,"

[Verse 1:]
Say you're sorry
You still care
She came by my place again
Cryin' about you man
You should love her
Twice as much
I try to remember you're a friend
But it's gettin' a little rough

[Chorus:]
She's just tired
Of bein' Cinderella
She can't live that way no more
She needs a little affection
A little understanding
You better be careful
'Cause the next time she comes to my door
She won't be a Cinderella no more

[Verse 2:]
A teardrop trembled
On her face
Where that smile always was
It seemed out of place
And when I held her
Like a friend
I could feel a sweet beginning
But taste a bitter end

[Chorus:]
She's just tired
Of bein' Cinderella
She can't live that way no more
She needs a little affection
A little understanding
You better be careful
'Cause the next time she comes to my door
You'll be sorry

[Verse 3:]
'Cause it seems like
It's always something with you
And everybody's always wrong
One of these nights
You'll reach for the pillow she sleeps on
And she's gonna be gone

How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me

Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him

[Verse]
I would have waited forever
If I'd known that you'd be here
We could have shared our lives together
And held each other close all through the years

But I've met someone before you
And my heart just couldn't wait
So no matter how much I adore you
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made

[Chorus]
Where were you when I could have loved you?
Where were you when I gave my heart away?
All my life
I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late

I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you
I can't have you but I never will forget you

1338,Anne Murray,42,Are You Still In Love With Me,1987,"

I can hear the cars out on the street
As I lie awake and watch you while you sleep
It seems that it was only yesterday
When you took my hand and carried me away

Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

Our children are the garden we have grown
I see so much of you in them I know
This house is filled with memories of the past
When no-one thought that you and I would last

Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

Now after all this time we've been together
Did you ever think the right one could be wrong?
I know you said you'd stay with me forever
I just can't believe your love would last so long
So now I think I'll put my fears away
If not for love you never would have stayed
Forgive me if I feel this way again
But I need to know you love me now and then

Cause everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

I guess I wonder why you're still in love with me

1339,Ray Stevens,43,Would Jesus Wear A Rolex,1987,"

Woke up this mornin', turned on the t.v. set
There in livin' color, was somethin' I can't forget
This man was preachin' at me, yeah, layin' on the charm
Askin' me for twenty, with ten-thousand on his arm
He wore designer clothes, and a big smile on his face
Sellin' me salvation while they sang Amazin' Grace
Askin' me for money, when he had all the signs of wealth
I almost wrote a check out, yeah, then I asked myself

(chorus)
Would He wear a pinky ring, would He drive a fancy car?
Would His wife wear furs and diamonds, would His dressin' room have a star?
If He came back tomorrow, well there's somethin' I'd like to know
Could ya tell me, Would Jesus wear a Rolex on His television show

Would Jesus be political if He came back to earth?
Have His second home in Palm Springs, yeah, a try to hide His worth?
Take money, from those poor folks, when He comes back again
And admit He's talked to all them preachers who say they been a talkin' to Him?

(chorus)
Just ask ya' self, Would He wear a pinky ring
Would He drive a fancy car?
Would His wife wear furs and diamonds, would His dressing room have a star?
If He came back tomorrow, well there's somethin' I'd like to know:
Could ya tell me, would Jesus wear a Rolex
Would jesus wear a Rolex
Would Jesus wear a Rolex
On His television show-ooh-ooh?

1340,Waylon Jennings,44,Fallin' Out,1987,"

[Verse 1]
We fell into a falling out
You are the one that I just can't figure out
But I do believe I want to
Like a girl in a picture show
You are the one that I'd like to know

[Chorus]
And I do, I do believe I need to
And I do, I do believe that I feel like
I'm watching a dove that's falling
It's love and it's going down
The songbird is calling a slipway darling
So if there's a way show me how
Just to tell you I love you

[Verse 2]
You don't have to show me what's in your eyes
Find me a way to apologize and I will
I do believe I need to
And you can take forever to sympathize
But you know it's raining in my insides
Because I do, I do believe I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I feel a broken heart tumbling
Do you remember what you said way back then
You used to say I love you
And lost in the light of a second chance
I feel the rhythm but you won't dance

1341,Gary Morris,45,Plain Brown Wrapper,1987,"

Lose the jewels, there's diamonds in your eyes
Lose the look, you're painted on disguise
Lose the dress, that hides the fairest prize

Lose the time, this time belongs to me
Lose your mind and let the moments be
Lose your all, you're all I'll ever need

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

Soon the years will surely fade away
Soon the time with lines and shades of gray
Soon the dreams will all be yesterdays

If all that's left is what we're feeling now
All that's changed won't matter anyhow
Rearranged, it's still the same somehow

When the outside's a plain brown wrapper
Still the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside was just for show

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

So lose the jewels
(Plain brown wrapper)
There's diamonds in your eyes
(Plain brown wrapper)

It hides the fairest prize
(Plain brown wrapper)
Rearranged, it's still the same
(Plain brown wrapper)

All the years

On the inside's solid gold
On the outside's just for show

She is fixed in his mind like the picture
He's kept in his wallet for years
And the image has never been tarnished
By the blood, sweat and tears
And to him it appears

That the moon is still over her shoulder
And the ribbon is still in her hair
And he can still see her dancing
And music is still in the air

Sometimes he finds it amazing
That all of his children are wed
When their mother is still turning eighteen
And turning his head
She still turns his head

And the moon is still over her shoulder
And the stars are still falling above
And she never gets one minute older
And he is still falling in love

I always take him back, though soon I know
He'll spend the night with you and let me cryin'
You don't love him, but you won't let him go

CHORUS

Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd fight you and I'd win, Lord knows I would
Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

No matter what you do, I'll do it better
You'll never be the woman I could be
But you don't have a heart or any feelings
So I can't even ask for sympathy

CHORUS

Oh whiskey, if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

1346,George Jones,50,I Turn To You,1987,"

Rivers turn to oceans and flow on to the sea, embers turn to ashes, and love to memories. Rain turns to rainbows and gray skies turn to blue. But when the world turns on me I turn to you

A thirsty man needs water. A bluebird needs the sky. A man needs his woman or he'll wither up and die. Roses need sunshine. Violets need the dew. But not half as much as I need you

Deep in my soul, and always on my mind, forever in my heart, you're the light that shines. Someone to hold when no one else will do. When the world turns on me I turn to you. When the world turns on my I turn to you

Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of driving up and down the interstate
But Charlie's had a good life
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer be counting the days

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves

They'll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
They'll do a lot of catching up a little at a time
With pieces of the old dream
They're gonna light the old flame
Doing what they please, leaving every other reason behind

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves

There's a lot of nice things
That he never told her
And he forgets to hold her
When she needs him sometimes

The promises he made her
He never got around to
Still the thought of leaving
Never crossed her mind

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

He forgets to call her
So he keeps her waiting
He's always breaking the plans that she's made
There's so many good things
That he never gave her
But it never mattered to her anyway

Cause what she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
And what she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

And he's just an ordinary guy
Like you and I
And she's looking at him with her heart
And not her eyes

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

What she sees
Is only what she wants to
What she has
She thinks is enough
What she does
Is just look at the good things
And what she is
Is a woman in love

Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

[Verse 2]
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

[Chorus]
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Verse 3]
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old-time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

[Verse 4]
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

[Chorus]
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

1351,The Oak Ridge Boys,5,True Heart,1988,"

Some people spend night and day
Making money they can hide away
They never know what they're working for
All they think about is making more

And every time the world spins round
There's a few more hearts that can't be found
Cause they never had nothing to hold on to
The way that I'm holding you

All I ever need is your true heart
Next to me when it's cold and dark
All I need to keep from falling apart
Is the beat of your true heart

Some people spend day and night
Trying to love everybody in sight
They never know what love is for
All they think about is keeping the score

And every time the world spins round
There's a few more hearts that can't be found
Cause they never had nothing to hold on to
The way that I'm holding you

All I ever need is your true heart
Next to me when it's cold and dark
All I need to keep from falling apart
Is the beat of your true heart
Your true heart

No they never had nothing to hold on to

All it took was just a whisper to start a flame burning in you
Now he's back and I'm blue

Ooh that old feeling filling you your dreams again
Ooh it comes stealing taking you away

I guess there's nothing left for me to do I can't stop him from living in you
Cause the past can only pull us apart still you carry it through

Ooh that old feeling...

(Dave Gibson/Craig Karp)

I know a man, a good friend of mine;
He spends all his time tryin' to make love work out right
But the woman he loves, she don't feel the same, no;
I don't know much about love but at least I learned one thing:

If it don't come easy, you better let it go
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow
Don't make it hard on your heart, you might be better off alone
If it don't come easy, you better let it go, yeah

I know a woman, she's got a heart of gold
You know she'd do anything to make her man feel right at home
But the man she loves, now, he's a restless kind of guy
I wish there was a way I could make her realise

That if it don't come easy, you better let it go
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow
Don't make it hard on your heart, when you might be better off alone
If it don't come easy, you better let it go, yeah

Let it go, though it's hard I know;
Let it loose, I tell you, it's no use

If it don't come easy, you better let it go
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow
Don't make it hard on your heart, when you might be better off alone
If it don't come easy, you better let it
You better let it
You better let it go

If it don't come easy, you better let it go
'Cos when it don't come easy, there's no natural flow

Oh, its late I know I should be leaving
We've both got someone waiting, we'll have to go
And it's so strange to think that I've just met you
I almost wish I had met you long ago

And in your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time

I'll admit in time that I'll forget you
'Cause the truth is I still love her after all
But even though we knew it couldn't happen
For a moment we felt something, Oh, so strong

And in your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time

And who knows just what we might have been
Another place another time...

Seems like every November
When the weather gets bad
I start to remember
All the good times we had
The long nights get longer
I Wish an friend would come by
The forecast is zero
And the chill factors high

But there is no wind this morning
And no wind on the way
There is a snowstorm inside me
With record high wind
And I'm colder this morning

1358,Dolly Parton  Linda Ronstadt  Emmylou Harris,12,Wildflowers,1988,"

[Verse]
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
I wanted so much to branch out
I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
Hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

You took all your possessions
The day you disappeared
There's nothing to remind me
That you were ever here

So why can't I forget you
Find someone else and just move on?
Why do I keep looking for you
When I know you've gone?

Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind

Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
Out of sight and on my mind

Haven't asked our friends about you
I don't call you on the phone
I never drive by that new place
That you're now calling home

Cause baby, you're the last one
That I should wanna see
But I still turn each corner
Hoping you'll run into me

Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me

Like a stranger in the dark

Honey you don't have to hurry just relax and take your time
I don't know what you don't tell me I don't mean to be unkind
Honey I can't read your mind

And things aren't working out
I can be the one who makes you happy

Call me on the telephone
Darling, I'm always home
If you ever change your mind

When the time is right
I can hold you tight
You know I can wait forever

And time is on our side
And we can surely find
All the love we'll ever need

And take a chance on this
Seal it with a kiss
I can be the one who makes you happy

Call me on the telephone
Darling, I'm always home

Baby, I could be there with you
If you ever change your mind

Call me on the telephone

They got a vintage Victrola 1951
Full of my favorite records that I grew up on
They got ole Hank and Lefty and there's B24
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'

Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours

Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'

All my neon neighbors they like what I play
Cause they've heard it every night since you've walked away
Every day they replace old B24
'Cause every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'

Every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours

Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I said set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'

1365,Steve Wariner,19,Baby I'm Yours,1988,"

Well, I've heard it said
""The grass is always greener""
We want what we can't have or so it seems
When I looked at you
The world never looked any sweeter
And I go home to her and see you in my dreams

So if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real, baby
I'm still not free
If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me

When the stars are out
Sometimes I still can remember
The clear September night we first met
Through the fall
I never looked at another
Then the winter came how quickly we forget

So if you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real
Baby, I'm still not free

If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me

Dream of me
I'll be dreamin' of you
I'll never forget how you told me
That your heart was taken too, you said

If you want someone to fill your wakin' hours
With a love that is real
Baby, I'm still not free

If you think you could fall for a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me
I'll be dreaming of you, babe
You can dream of me

1366,Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,20,Workin' Man (Nowhere To Go),1988,"

Sittin' alone in the dark
Wastin' my time in a park
'Cause I've got
Nowhere to go

Had me a job 'til the market fell out
Tried hard to borrow but there was no help
Now I've got
Nowhere to go

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

One last look at my land
Auctioneer with his gavel in hand
And he says, ""It's got to go""

Worked this piece all my life
It broke my heart and it took my wife
Now I've got nothing to show

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

Wandered aimless in the city
With my dirt workin' boots
And my old straw hat in hand

Singing a song by Woody Guthrie
This land is your land
It ain't my land

I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

I was born to the sunrise
Breaking back all day
Now I've got
Something to say

I am broke but not broken
And I am not alone
'Cause there's a lot of folks
With nowhere to go

Are they ever gonna understand
You can't leave a workin' man
Nowhere to go

Are they ever gonna understand
You can't leave a workin' man
Nowhere to go

Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

1367,Michael Johnson,21,I Will Whisper Your Name,1988,"

Tonight I am thankful 'cause tomorrow begins
A lifetime together and two hearts will win
I have loved you as surely as love has no shame
For as long as you're listening, I'll whisper your name

I will whisper your name when you're wounded and caught
Or when love beats so loudly, a whisper is lost
And if I made the rules and if time was the game
I would promise forever to whisper your name

Well if you strike a match and set the whole world aflame
And they used up the oceans and still prayed for rain
When they cry for the guilty, I'll take the blame
And when no one is listening, I'll whisper your name

I will whisper your name when you're wounded and caught
Or when love beats so loudly, a whisper is lost
And if I made the rules and if time was the game
I would promise forever to whisper your name

"
1368,Conway Twitty,22,Goodbye Time,1988,"

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun what else can I say
If the feelings gone words won't stop you anyway

If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

"
1369,David Lynn Jones,23,High Ridin' Heroes,1988,"

[Verse 1]
Daylight or midnight
Red eyes and that old hat
Whiskey-spent and busted flat
And a credit to his flaws
He's a bad risk and a good friend
Small change and loose ends
And he only regrets that he might've been
A little faster on the draw

[Chorus]
Hey, those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
He's been to hell and Texas
And he knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
Drunk on some back street
Fallin' off the wagon
And under the wheels

[Verse 2]
Time was when he was king
Now the rodeo's just an old man's dream
The highs are few and far between
The lows get the rest
But these old hard times ain't nothin' new
Once you've done the best you can do
You just tip your hat to the wild and blue
Ride off to the west

[Chorus]
Hey, those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
He's been to hell and Texas
And he knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
Drunk on some back street
Fallin' off the wagon
And under the wheels

We are young contry, we are the pride
The sons and the daughters of American live
Our hair is not orange, we don't wear chains and spikes
But we know how to have fun, come Saturday night

We know what's right, we know what's wrong
We know what we like, to hear in a song
We like some of the old stuff, we like some of the new
But we do our own choosen, we pick our own music
If you don't mind thank you

We are young country, we like all kinds
Of music and people, cuz we don't draw no lines
No our hair is not orange,we don't wear chains and spikes
But we know how to have fun come Saturday night

We like old Waylon, hey we know Van Hallen
We like ZZ Top , we like country and rock
Old Hank would be proud and Elvis would too
We like our country mixed with some big city blu's

We are young contry, we are the pride

1372,Foster & Lloyd,26,Texas In 1880,1988,"

I can hear the wind whisper my name
Tellin' me it's time to head out again
My horses are trailered and the lights are shut down
And I'm long overdue for headin' outta town

Got a fever that they call rodeo
Just enough winnin' to make the next show
Sometimes you make eight, sometimes you hit dirt
Go on, pin another number to the back of my shirt

[Chorus:]
And I'll ride that pony fast
Like a cowboy from the past
Be young and wild free
Like Texas in 1880
Just like Texas in 1880

Ah, from Phoenix to Tulsa to the Astro Dome
New York City down to San Antone
There's boys that are ridin' for legendary fame
And our money's all gone but we ride just the same

Our hearts got broken, and our heads get busted
But we'll always believe the things that we trust
There'll be those nights when glory comes 'round
And we'll tip our hats and wave to the crowd

[Chorus]
Someday, when you're older
Someone see
That buckle hangin' there on your belt
Ask you just how it felt!

[Chorus]
Just like Texas
Just like Texas

1373,Exile,27,Just One Kiss,1988,"

If I could make one wish
And have it come true
All that I could hope for
Is for just one night with you
'Cause that's all it takes
And that's all I need
It doesn't take much of your love
To satisfy me

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

I was a loner, I had to be free
I never needed anyone around
To depend on me
But that was before you made me see
That falling in love could be painless
You made it look easy

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

I wonder how I ever got by
I wonder how I ever made it
Without you in my life
I don't know how I ever survived

Just one kiss goes a long long way
Just a little of your love
Can get me through the day
Just one touch and my heart remains
Just one kiss goes a long long way

Ooh baby, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah darling, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah baby, just one kiss goes a long long way
Yeah darling, just one kiss goes a long long way

1374,Southern Pacific,28,Midnight Highway,1988,"

I can't think of one reason
I like the things I do
I take a ride on a good feeling
Knowing it'll see me through
Like a drive down a dusty highway
After the sun's gone down
Chasing shadows into the new day
Leavin' this lonely town

I'm gonna rock, ride nothing to hide
Let the headlights guide me
I'm gonna roll right into the night
Take the midnight highway
Midnight highway

I knew a girl, now she's a woman
We used to watch the road at night
Dream about where the road could take us
Counting all the red taillights
Now she stands at the kitchen window
Staring at the old highway
There's still a girl inside the woman
If you listen you can hear her say

I'm gonna rock, ride nothing to hide
Let the headlights guide me
I'm gonna roll right into the night
Take the midnight highway
Midnight highway

Like a drive down a dusty highway
After the sun's gone down
Chasing shadows into the new day
Leavin' this lonely town

I'm gonna rock, ride nothing to hide
Let the headlights guide me
I'm gonna roll right into the night
Take the midnight highway
Midnight highway

Take the midnight highway
Midnight highway
I'm gonna take the midnight highway
Midnight highway
Gonna take the midnight highway...

Even now in my arms you still want him I know
But darling this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight, don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes, let it be me

Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Lying here in your arms, knowing he's in your mind

I laughed it off when she left
I thought she'd come back again
Don't we all have the right
To be wrong now and then

She won't come home, she says her love
Will never be mine again
Don't we all have the right
To be wrong now and then

Guess I wasn't so smart after all
I forgot that with love, there are two ways to fall

I laughed it off when she left
I thought she'd come back again
Don't we all have the right
To be wrong now and then

Guess I wasn't so smart after all
I forgot that with love, there are two ways to fall

She won't come home, says her love
Will never be mine again
Don't we all have the right
To be wrong now and then
Don't we all have the right
To be wrong now and then

You're gonna love me

I'm gonna get you

When you're driftin' off to sleep
Close your eyes and think of me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't dream about nobody else

'Cause, I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

You can run and you can hide
But in the end you'll realize
You've been runnin' right to me
Turn around and there I'll be

I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

It ain't a matter of chance
Honey, it's destiny
There ain't no gettin' away
It's just the way it's gonna be

I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me

I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know
It's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

And I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I want a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms needs someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah

Yeah, I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
A Wednesday or a Thursday
Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothing baby
But I need a Sunday kind of love

She looked so much like a lady, but she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew
She's go away when the grass turned green and the sky turned baby blue

[Chorus]
And baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Verse 2]
She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue

[Chorus]
And baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

Baby blue was the color of her eyes

She use to sit there by the window
Worrying half to death, waiting for my car
Not knowing if or when I'd come home
And when I finally would, she'd be right there at the door
She used to cry and carry on
Those were the days but now they're gone
She doesn't cry anymore
She don't wait up at night, she don't put up a fight
Her heart doesn't ache like before
I went too far, I guess she's had enough
She's given up on love, she doesn't cry anymore
What was I thinking? I must've been crazy
'Cause when she needed me, I was never there
What I wouldn't do for one more chance now?
Just one ray of hope, a sign that she still cares
No use trying to apologize, no use trying to dry her eyes
She doesn't cry anymore
She don't wait up at night, she don't put up a fight
Her heart doesn't ache like before
I went too far, I guess she'd had enough
She's given up on love, she doesn't cry anymore
I guess she's had enough
She's given up on love, she doesn't cry anymore

1384,Kenny Rogers,38,The Factory,1988,"

I can't say that he loved his work
But he fed a family of nine
Papa never heard of union
He logged his scale in time
But he was a lucky man
At least he had a job
Down at the fact'ry

40 years cut across his back
Fightin' it tooth and nail
Work was hard enough to make
A man forget his fear of Hell
He was a thankful man
He had a job
Down at the fact'ry

Sometimes through the walls at night
I'd hear him on his knees
Prayin', ""Lord, please help me
Through another day
Give me strength
And bless this house
This family of mine
And thank you, Lord, for my job
Down at the fact'ry""

It's hard for a man
To build a life
On a miller's pay
But like father
Just like son
At least I could pay my way

I'm a lucky man
I've got a job
Down at the fact'ry

As I put my kids to bed
Wonder what's in store
Ask the Lord for a better way
'Cause they deserve much more
Than to raise their own
With just a job
Down at the fact'ry

Sometimes when it's late at night
I get down on my knees
Prayin, ""Lord, please help me
Through another day
And give me strength
And bless this house
This family of mine
And, thank you, lord, for my job
Down at the fact'ry""

We got more than some
At least I got a job
Down at the fact'ry

I knew love
When it still meant forever
When a feeling shared didn't always have to hurt
And a promise that was made would go unbroken
I knew love

I knew a time
When hope was all you needed
And if you cared you found a way to make things work
When life was what two people shared together
Oh, I knew love
When it was more than a word

Chorus
I knew love
When I could still believe
It was the greatest power in the world
I knew love
When it was more than just a word

When I wouldn't have to read this note that says you're leaving
I knew love
When it was more than just a word

I knew love when it was more than just a word

Sometimes it easy
And sometimes its not
Sometimes I can't think of one thing we've got
A common to keep us from falling apart
To keep holding on with love in our hearts
Sometimes it's heaven
And sometimes it's hell
Sometimes it seems we would be just as well
Off on our own knowing somebody else
Then I think about all we've been through

There have been so many nights that you've saved me
There have been so many mornings you gave me
The courage to get up and get outta bed
To face the world one more day
There have been so many trials we've conquered together
So many miles of rough roads we've weathered
And I swear forever that I'll never leave
Cause lady I still believe

You can bring out my best
You can bring out my worst
You feed every hunger
Then leave me burning with thirst
And at the moment that I know that I'll surely die
You love is my fountain of life

There have been so many nights that you've saved me
There have been so many mornings you gave me
The courage to get up and get outta bed
To face the world one more day
There have been so many trials we've conquered together
So many miles of rough roads we've weathered
And I swear forever that I'll never leave
Cause lady I still believe

Oh Lady I still believe

But she has never turned the page
Shes put it off for so long
She never thought shed feel so strong now
Shes ready to leave her troubles behind

And in the rearview mirror
I watched it go

Another town
Another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely praying before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

Her memory fills my mind

Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right?

You pay a price
But I can't forget the tears in her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky

Did I wait too long?
How can I make it right?

I'm gonna love her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll get her back the only way I know
I'm gonna love her on the rad-i-o

Take these pieces of this broken heart
I'll watch them climb the country music charts
Sing about our love the way it use to be
Even if she don’t love me

I'm gonna love her on the radio
She's gonna hear me everywhere she goes
I'll get her back the only way I know
I'm gonna love her on the rad-i-o

Gonna tell the world the way she done me wrong
I’ll make a million while she sings along
She thinks she's heard the last of my love song
But she won't feel that way for long

I'm gonna love her on the radio
I'm gonna get to her in stereo
I'll get her back the only way I know
I'm gonna love her on the rad-i-o

I'm gonna love her on the radio
I'm gonna get to her in stereo
I'll get her back the only way I know
I'm gonna love her on the rad-i-o

I'm gonna get to her in stereo

I'm gonna love her on the rad-i-o (Fade Out)

There never was a little girl more wanted than me
I had all the love a child could ever want or need
Daddy gave me everything he could afford to buy
An' on the ceilin' in my room he painted me a sky

He told me not to be afraid when it stormed outside
He said, ""In your room, sweetheart the sun will always shine""
An' through the years of growin' up if somethin' made me cry
It didn't seem to hurt so bad beneath the painted sky

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true and no one ever says, ""Goodbye""
Oh, I wish that I could live again beneath the painted sky

Girls grow up and fall in love and that's how it is
Sometimes the men don't love 'em like their Daddy's did
Sometimes the hurt's so bad, the way it is tonight
It makes me wanna be back home beneath the painted sky

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true and no one ever says, ""Goodbye""
Oh, I wish that I could live again beneath the painted sky
Oh, I wish I was a kid again beneath the painted sky

IT'S JUST A LITTLE CREEK NOW
BUT WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN

1394,Mel McDaniel,48,Real Good Feel Good Song,1988,"

Did ya ever wake up in the mornin' nothing was a goin' right
Spent the whole night fussin' and a fightin' with your wife?

Bills out in the mailbox you know that you can't pay
Then you try to leave for work and your cars been towed away?
What you needed was a

'Real Good Feel Good Song'
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

A friend of mine was a workin' hard, savin' all his pay
Like Jesse James, the IRS stole most of it away
Then he got chased by a street gang

And he finally found a phone
He called up the police and they put him on hold
What he needed was a

'Real Good Feel Good Song'
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

They say, music charms the savage beast and I believe it's true
Man's had it down thru' history when he's had the blues
He'd find a drum to beat on and a horn that he could blow

You know it worked for the children of a Israel
At the walls of Jericho
They brought the house down with a

'Real Good Feel Good Song'
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

'Real Good Feel Good Song'
One that makes you feel alright when everything goes wrong
One that makes you move your feet and makes you sing along
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'
You need a 'Real Good Feel Good Song'

The coffee's all gone
And my eyes burn like fire
It's way past the hour
When most folks retire
You told me you'd call me
But you haven't yet
And I'm down to my last cigarette

I'm down to my last cigarette
For I know what made you forget
You're still out there somewhere
With someone you met
And I'm down to my last cigarette

I can't leave this room
You might call while I'm gone
The minutes seem like hours
It soon will be dawn
And on top of all
Of my tears and regrets
I'm down to my last cigarette

I'm down to my last cigarette
And I'm trying so hard to forget
But you're still out there somewhere
With someone you met
And I'm down to my last cigarette
Oh I'm down to my last cigarette

1397,Rodney Crowell,1,After All This Time,1989,"

There were trains
And we out-run 'em
There were songs
And we out-sung 'em
There were brighter days never ending
There was time
And we were burnin'
There were rhymes
And we were learnin'
There was all the love two hearts could hold

And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let it end
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you

There was rain
That we outlasted
There was pain
But we got past it
There were last goodbyes still left unspoken
There were ways I should have thrilled you
There were days I could have killed you
You're the only love my life has known

And after all this time
You're always on my mind
Hey I could never let you go
A broken heart that heals so slow
Could never beat for someone new
While you're alive and I am too
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still miss you

And I could never let it in
'Cause my heart takes so long to mend
The dream that keeps your hopes alive
The lonely nights you hold inside
And after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still want you
Hey after all this time
You're always on my mind
I still love you

1398,Steve Wariner,2,Where Did I Go Wrong,1989,"

When you told me that you loved me
I believed every single word you said
Then you showed me, that you didn't mean it
That you loved somebody else, instead
I know you've got a right to find someone new
Well, I've got a right to feel this way, too
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
And now I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
There was something all around us
Like I'd never felt before
Guess I should've seen it coming
I was busy comin' back for more
I know you've got a right to change your mind
Well, I got a right to be losing mine
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
I know I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Where did he go right?
I know I'd won the battle if I'd known there was a fight
I can't stand the thought of never holding you tight
Where did I go wrong and he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?
Where did I go wrong? Tell me where did he go right?

What do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing, you know, we take the fall

Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear

I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

I guess, I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old, 'Meant to be'

Still, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man

Oh but deep inside my heart you're the most important part
Oh I'm just no good at love....... out....... loud

When you're here beside me
Deep......in my arms
I can't seem to get my feelings out
I know that you deserve
The tenderness of words
But I'm.... just no good at love..... out...... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

There's some real good talkers
I hear them every day
But I'm not sure they know what love's about
Oh, but everything I do is a silent ""I love you!""
And I'm just no good at love..... out..... loud

Love out loud it don't come easy
Love out loud is hard for me
Deep inside my heart is singing
And reciting poetry
Please don't read my silence as a cause for any doubt
I'm just no good at love
I'm just no good at love

1401,The Desert Rose Band,5,She Don't Love Nobody,1989,"

From my humble point of view she don't love nobody
Nothin' borrowed nothin' blue she don't love nobody
Behind the greeen eyes I detect she don't love nobody
Her heart no kiss could resurrect she don't love nobody
All her life she's been told to hang on tight
There's a man who'd make her his wife
But she's not interested in anything mama said
She throws passion to the wind she don't love nobody
She don't give out but she don't give in she don't love nobody
[ guitar - steel ]
And if I could I'd make her mine but she don't love nobody
She would never walk that line she don't love nobody
All my life I'd been told to hang on tight
There's a girl who'd be my wife
But I'm not interested in anything mama said
I want the girl who does not need she don't love nobody
She's the one my heart receives she don't love nobody
She don't love nobody oh she don't love nobody
She don't love nobody she don't love nobody
She don't love nobody she don't love nobody

I've had to buy back damn near everything I own
From a little man whose name is Saul
And has a lot of money to loan
I drive a beat up '67 Chevrolet
With a torn up seat
That pokes a brand new hole in my back near every day
I got a letter from the folks over at Bell
Just to let me know my next phone call
I could walk outside and yell
Hey, I know my life seems a mess
But honey, things to me still look real swell

'Cause I've got you to see me through
Yeah, I've got you, oh, to chase my blues
I've got you to ease my pain
Yeah, I've got you, girl, to keep me sane
So let 'em do what they want to do
'Cause it don't matter, long as I got you

I've got the landlord breathing down my neck for rent
Oh, he don't give a damn about my kids or where the money was spent
And after all those years of payin' union dues
It sure didn't seem to count for much when we got our layoff news
I got a note from the man over at the bank
Said the next ten gallons of gas I buy won't be going in my tank
Hey, I know I might seem near dead
But honey, I think I might just get well

'Cause I've got you to see me through
Yeah, I've got you, oh, to chase my blues
I've got you to ease my pain
Honey, I've got you, oh, to keep me sane

Yeah, let 'em go right ahead and sue

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If he turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if he's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I waited for too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for him

Though tonight he's made me sad
I still love him
If I find him I'll be glad
I still love him

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If he turns up while I'm gone please let me know

She's a small town girl with no room to grow
And he's a reckless boy with no where to go
They're like birds in a cage with no place to fly
So he parks the car and she holds him tight

And they rage on some how searching for the answers
In the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone
They rage on

On the same dark night two more people meet
In a rented room on a cross town street
And she's lost her youth and he's lost his dreams
But for a while they feel like they used to feel

And they rage on
Against the lives that this world gave them
Hoping something's there to save them
They rage on rage on

And somewhere between right and wrong
In the grey between dusk and dawn
They tell themselves they're not alone
Cause they rage on

And they rage on some how searching for the answers
In the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone
They rage on

They rage on against the lives that this life gave them
Hoping something's there to save them
They rage on they rage on

If your world comes crashing down;
If you need comfort but it can't be found;
If you're lonely, you can always call on me

If nobody is listening to you
I'll be the walls you tell your secrets to
If you want me, night or day, just call on me

I'm not asking for rings of gold
Just one ring on my telephone
I'm just wanting a chance to prove
That my love is true;
If it connects with you
Call on me

There's no-one that I call mine
I'm only held by the hands of time
And it's a long wait, hoping you will call on me

There's nothin' silent as a 'phone that won't ring
Nothin' louder than your voice in my dreams
It's a heartache knowing you don't call on me

I'm not asking for rings of gold
Just one ring on my telephone
I'm just wanting a chance to prove
That my love is true;
If it connects with you
Call on me. (Call on me.)

Yeah, (Call on me.)

If you ever wanna get me on the line
You got my number, it's this heart of mine
I'm not asking for a ring of gold
Just a love that won't turn cold
Call on me
Call me, yeah

My daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're gonna have to learn to let go
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work
Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember

There's such a thing as trying too hard
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work
You got to sing sometimes like you don't need the money
Love sometimes like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance, dance, dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart if you want it to work

I wish that I could feel that way again
I remember those summer nights on the brink of love
You and I made more then plans back then

We were gonna try to set the world on fire
We were gonna make it all come true
We used to say that we couldn't wait to leave this town
That was something we were born to do

1411,The Oak Ridge Boys,15,Beyond Those Years,1989,"

Full moons and empty promises
We were only high school kids
We got so close that we closed our eyes
To the facts of life
We were married in the spring
Not long before the baby came
Your mama said she couldn't bare the shame
Your dad refused to give the bride away

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it's way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years

Eighteen standing in the shoes of a man
The weight of the world in my unskilled hands
One by one as the dreams fell through
I took my failures out on you
But you held on when it made no sense
And cleaned the face of the innocent
You were so strong to be so young
And now look just how far we've come

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it's way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years

So many times we wanted to act our age
Call it off and go our seperate ways
Against the odds we grew up too fast
And on our own, yer we made it last
Oo we made it last

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it's way
Through all those tears
Beyond those years

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it's way
Through all those tears

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standing here?
And that love would find it's way

1412,Randy Travis,16,Is It Still Over,1989,"

Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doin' fine
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing
I've ever tried to do
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

I tore my letter up, I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really here in my heart
There's only so much that words can say
So I send you a piece of this beautiful day

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

In a day or two - just you wait and see
You're gonna get a special delivery
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt
When you open it up and let the love spill out

Nothing grows in the driest places
The bitter cold or children's faces
Like love will
Love will

Nothing can be everlasting
Or send an iron curtain crashing
Like love will
Love will

Love's a gift the richest or the poorest man can give
It's the only treasure that I know
Love will not forsake you on the last day that you live
'Cause you can take it with you when you go

You can do the world a favor
Love yourself and love your neighbor
If you will
Love will

Someone leaves and we've all been through it
Tears don't help
And words won't do it
But love will
Love will

I don't want to be there if we all wake up to late
Love's the only weapon
That is strong enough for hate

You can do the world a favor
Love yourself and love your neighbor
If you will
Oh, if you will, love will, love will
Oooh
Love will, love will, love will

1417,Paul Overstreet,21,Sowin' Love,1989,"

I use to love to walk behind my daddy
As he plowed our garden every spring
Our little bare feet in the dirt would make me happy
As we talked about what harvest time would bring
He'd say son this whole world is like a garden
And what you sow your surely gonna reap
Where bitter seeds are planted hearts will harden
But a caring hand will make the harvest sweet

Chorus:
And he was sowin' love for the family
Yeah he was sowin' love, he took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
Like a good father does he was sowin' love

And how I use to love and sit and watch my momma
Workin' with her needle and her thread
So patiently she'd listen to our problems
And we knew she heard every word we said
She'd say ""children this old world is full of scratches
And in your life your bound to have a few""
I guess that's why the good Lord gave us patches
So we could start each day out feelin' new

Chorus:
Yes she was sowin' love for the family
She was sowin' love, she took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
Like a good momma does she was sowin' love

Chorus:
Yeah they were sowin' love for the family
They were sowin' love, they took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
They took good care of us they were sowin' love

Yeah they did it all for us they were sowin' love

1418,George Strait,22,What's Going On In Your World,1989,"

[Verse 1]
What's going on in your world? I hope that you're doing fine
I just called to say there's not a day that you don't cross my mind
I just wanted to see if you feel like me - sorry that we said goodbye
So what's going on in your world? It sure is lonesome in mine

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you're happy and I'll hang up the phone
Just tell me you don't need me anymore and I'll leave you alone
I just wondered if you had somebody new after all of this time
So what's going on in your world? It sure is lonesome in mine

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What's going on in your world? It sure is lonesome in mine

1419,Ronnie Milsap,23,Houston Solution,1989,"

I've got some friends down in Houston
Who know me quite well
They'll be more than happy to put me up for a spell
I can hang out or hide out whichever I choose
They won't ask me questions about why I've got the blues

I've got a Houston solution in mind
All it takes is a call on the telephone line
And I can leave all these problems in Nashville behind
I've got a Houston solution in mind

Well, my Daddy once told me you can't run away
Your troubles will follow and find you some day
There's no need to argue cause he's probably right
But I've run out of options and I'm leaving tonight

I've got a Houston solution in mind
All it takes is a call on the telephone line
And I can leave all these problems in Nashville behind
I've got a Houston solution in mind

I've got a Houston solution in mind
I've got a Houston solution...

1420,Merle Haggard,24,5:01 Blues,1989,"

[Chorus]
I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I'll punch out and put in
Another long night again, missing you
I got these 5:01 blues

[Verse 1]
I used to watch that old clock on the wall
Wishing I could make time fly
But ever since you walked out on me
Quitting time just make me want to cry

[Chorus]
I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I'll punch out and put in
Another long night again, loving you
I've got these 5:01 blues

[Verse 2]
I could go out and find somebody new
I'd only spoil her fun
My mind still says that it's time to love you
When the clock says the workday is done

[Chorus][x2]
I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I'll punch out and put in
Another long night again, missing you
I've got these 5:01 blues

[Outro]
Oh man, I got no place to go
No one to go to

1422,Conway Twitty,26,She's Got A Single Thing In Mind,1989,"

She can't find the words to break it to me
Cause she always was the gentle kind
She's hopin' I'll hear it from a friend somewhere
She's hopin' I'll read between the lines
But it comes as no surprise
Cause she told me with her eyes

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

She's already gone, except in body
It's just a matter now, of time
Well I should have seen the storm clouds gathering
But he who won't look is just as blind
So there's only me to blame
When my woman dropped my name

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

So watch her untie the tie that binds
She's got a single thing in mind

1423,The McCarters,27,Up And Gone,1989,
1424,Reba McEntire,28,Cathy's Clown,1989,"

[Chorus]
I want your loving more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time
I hear the sound
They're saying here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown

[Verse]
You know you've got to stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
And when you let her tell you lies
And you let them pass you by
You're not a man at all

She doesn't want your loving anymore
She doesn't want your kisses that's for sure
Why do you let them put you down
And let them call you Cathy's Clown

When you see me shed a tear
Then you know that I'm sincere
I just think it's kind of sad
That she's treating you so bad
And I'm the one who cares

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You're Cathy's Clown [x2]

1425,James House,29,Don't Quit Me Now,1989,"

O
tell me all about
Anna Livia! I want to hear all

about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course, we all know Anna Livia. Tell me all. Tell me now. You’ll die when you hear. Well, you know, when the old cheb went futt and did what you know. Yes, I know, go on. Wash quit and don’t be dabbling. Tuck up your sleeves and loosen your talk-tapes. And don’t butt me — hike! — when you bend. Or what — ever it was they threed to make out he thried to two in the Fiendish park. He’s an awful old reppe. Look at the shirt of him ! Look at the dirt of it! He has all my water black on me. And it steeping and stuping since this time last wik. How many goes is it I wonder I washed it? I know by heart the places he likes to saale, duddurty devil! Scorching my hand and starving my fa-mine to make his private linen public. Wallop it well with your battle and clean it. My wrists are wrusty rubbing the mouldaw stains. And the dneepers of wet and the gangres of sin in it! What was it he did a tail at all on Animal Sendai? And how long was he under loch and neagh? It was put in the newses what he did, nicies and priers, the King fierceas Humphrey, with illysus dis-tilling, exploits and all. But toms will till. I know he well. Temp untamed will hist for no man. As you spring so shall you neap. O, the roughty old rappe! Minxing marrage and making loof. Reeve Gootch was right and Reeve Drughad was sinistrous! And the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his head as high as a howeth, the famous eld duke alien, with a hump of grandeur on him like a walking wiesel rat. And his derry’s own drawl and his corksown blather and his doubling stutter and his gullaway swank. Ask Lictor Hackett or Lector Reade of Garda Growley or the Boy with the Billyclub. How elster is he a called at all? Qu’appelle? Huges Caput Earlyfouler. Or where was he born or how was he found? Urgothland, Tvistown on the Kattekat? New Hunshire, Concord on the Merrimake? Who blocksmitt her saft anvil or yelled lep to her pail? Was her banns never loosened in Adam and Eve’s or were him and her but captain spliced? For mine ether duck I thee drake. And by my wildgaze I thee gander. Flowey and Mount on the brink of time makes wishes and fears for a happy isthmass. She can show all her lines, with love, license to play. And if they don’t remarry that hook and eye may! O, passmore that and oxus another! Don Dom Dombdomb and his wee follyo! Was his help inshored in the Stork and Pelican against bungelars, flu and third risk par-ties? I heard he dug good tin with his doll, delvan first and duvlin after, when he raped her home, Sabrine asthore, in a parakeet’s cage, by dredgerous lands and devious delts, playing catched and mythed with the gleam of her shadda, (if a flic had been there to pop up and pepper him!) past auld min’s manse and Maisons Allfou and the rest of incurables and the last of immurables, the quaggy waag for stumbling. Who sold you that jackalantern’s tale? Pemmican’s pasty pie! Not a grasshoop to ring her, not an antsgrain of ore. In a gabbard he barqued it, the boat of life, from the harbourless Ivernikan Okean, till he spied the loom of his landfall and he loosed two croakers from under his tilt, the gran Phenician rover. By the smell of her kelp they made the pigeonhouse. Like fun they did! But where was Himself, the timoneer? That marchantman he suivied their scutties right over the wash, his cameleer’s burnous breezing up on him, till with his runagate bowmpriss he roade and borst her bar. Pilcomayo! Suchcaughtawan! And the whale’s away with the grayling! Tune your pipes and fall ahumming, you born ijypt, and you’re no-thing short of one! Well, ptellomey soon and curb your escumo. When they saw him shoot swift up her sheba sheath, like any gay lord salomon, her bulls they were ruhring, surfed with spree. Boyarka buah! Boyana bueh! He erned his lille Bunbath hard, our staly bred, the trader. He did. Look at here. In this wet of his prow. Don’t you know he was kaldt a bairn of the brine, Wasserbourne the waterbaby? Havemmarea, so he was! H.C.E. has a codfisck ee. Shyr she’s nearly as badher as him herself. Who? Anna Livia? Ay, Anna Livia. Do you know she was calling bakvandets sals from all around, nyumba noo, chamba choo, to go in till him, her erring cheef, and tickle the pontiff aisy-oisy? She was? Gota pot! Yssel that the limmat? As El Negro winced when he wonced in La Plate. O, tell me all I want to hear, how loft she was lift a laddery dextro! A coneywink after the bunting fell. Letting on she didn’t care, sina feza, me absantee, him man in passession, the proxenete! Proxenete and phwhat is phthat? Emme for your reussischer Honddu jarkon! Tell us in franca langua. And call a spate a spate. Did they never sharee you ebro at skol, you antiabecedarian? It’s just the same as if I was to go par examplum now in conservancy’s cause out of telekinesis and proxenete you. For coxyt sake and is that what she is? Botlettle I thought she’d act that loa. Didn’t you spot her in her windaug, wubbling up on an osiery chair, with a meusic before her all cunniform letters, pretending to ribble a reedy derg on a fiddle she bogans without a band on? Sure she can’t fiddan a dee, with bow or abandon! Sure, she can’t! Tista suck. Well, I never now heard the like of that! Tell me moher. Tell me moatst. Well, old Humber was as glommen as grampus, with the tares at his thor and the buboes for ages and neither bowman nor shot abroad and bales allbrant on the crests of rockies and nera lamp in kitchen or church and giant’s holes in Grafton’s causeway and deathcap mushrooms round Funglus grave and the great tribune’s barrow all darnels occumule, sittang sambre on his sett, drammen and drommen, usking queasy quizzers of his ruful continence, his childlinen scarf to encourage his obsequies where he’d check their debths in that mormon’s thames, be questing and handsetl, hop, step and a deepend, with his berths in their toiling moil, his swal-lower open from swolf to fore and the snipes of the gutter pecking his crocs, hungerstriking all alone and holding doomsdag over hunselv, dreeing his weird, with his dander up, and his fringe combed over his eygs and droming on loft till the sight of the sternes, after zwarthy kowse and weedy broeks and the tits of buddy and the loits of pest and to peer was Parish worth thette mess. You’d think all was dodo belonging to him how he durmed adranse in durance vaal. He had been belching for severn years. And there she was, Anna Livia, she darent catch a winkle of sleep, purling around like a chit of a child, Wendawanda, a finger-thick, in a Lapsummer skirt and damazon cheeks, for to ishim bonzour to her dear dubber Dan. With neuphraties and sault from his maggias. And an odd time she’d cook him up blooms of fisk and lay to his heartsfoot her meddery eygs, yayis, and staynish beacons on toasc and a cupenhave so weeshywashy of Greenland’s tay or a dzoupgan of Kaffue mokau an sable or Sikiang sukry or his ale of ferns in trueart pewter and a shin-kobread (hamjambo, bana?) for to plaise that man hog stay his stomicker till her pyrraknees shrunk to nutmeg graters while her togglejoints shuck with goyt and as rash as she’d russ with her peakload of vivers up on her sieve (metauwero rage it swales and rieses) my hardey Hek he’d kast them frome him, with a stour of scorn, as much as to say you sow and you sozh, and if he didn’t peg the platteau on her tawe, believe you me, she was safe enough. And then she’d esk to vistule a hymn, The Heart Bowed Down or The Rakes of Mallow or Chelli Michele’s La Calumnia Š un Vermicelli or a balfy bit ov old Jo Robidson. Sucho fuffing a fifeing ‘twould cut you in two! She’d bate the hen that crowed on the turrace of Babbel. What harm if she knew how to cockle her mouth! And not a mag out of Hum no more than out of the mangle weight. Is that a faith? That’s the fact. Then riding the ricka and roya romanche, Annona, gebroren aroostokrat Nivia, dochter of Sense and Art, with Sparks’ pirryphlickathims funk-ling her fan, anner frostivying tresses dasht with virevlies, — while the prom beauties sreeked nith their bearers’ skins!— in a period gown of changeable jade that would robe the wood of two cardinals’ chairs and crush poor Cullen and smother Mac–Cabe. O blazerskate! Theirs porpor patches! And brahming to him down the feedchute, with her femtyfyx kinds of fondling endings, the poother rambling off her nose: Vuggybarney, Wickerymandy! Hello, ducky, please don’t die! Do you know what she started cheeping after, with a choicey voicey like water-glucks or Madame Delba to Romeoreszk? You’ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. Phoebe, dearest, tell, O tell me and I loved you better nor you knew. And letting on hoon var daft about the warbly sangs from over holmen: High hellskirt saw ladies hensmoker lily-hung pigger: and soay and soan and so firth and so forth in a tone sonora and Oom Bothar below like Bheri–Bheri in his sandy cloak, so umvolosy, as deaf as a yawn, the stult! Go away! Poor deef old deary! Yare only teasing! Anna Liv? As chalk is my judge! And didn’t she up in sorgues and go and trot doon and stand in her douro, puffing her old dudheen, and every shirvant siligirl or wensum farmerette walking the pilend roads, Sawy, Fundally, Daery or Maery, Milucre, Awny or Graw, usedn’t she make her a simp or sign to slip inside by the sullyport? You don’t say, the sillypost? Bedouix but I do! Calling them in, one by one (To Blockbeddum here! Here the Shoebenacaddie!) and legging a jig or so on the sihl to show them how to shake their benders and the dainty how to bring to mind the gladdest garments out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a sort of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and holding up a silliver shiner. Lordy, lordy, did she so? Well, of all the ones ever I heard! Throwing all the neiss little whores in the world at him! To inny captured wench you wish of no matter what sex of pleissful ways two adda tammar a lizzy a lossie to hug and hab haven in Humpy’s apron!

And what was the wyerye rima she made! Odet! Odet! Tell me the trent of it while I’m lathering hail out of Denis Florence MacCarthy’s combies. Rise it, flut ye, pian piena! I’m dying down off my iodine feet until I lerryn Anna Livia’s cushingloo, that was writ by one and rede by two and trouved by a poule in the parco! I can see that, I see you are. How does it tummel? Listen now. Are you listening? Yes, yes! Idneed I am! Tarn your ore ouse! Essonne inne!

By earth end the cloudy but I badly went e brandnew bankside, bedamp and I do, and a plumper at that!

For the putty affair I have is wore out, so it is, sitting, yaping and waiting for my old Dane hodder dodderer, my life in death companion, my frugal key of our larder, my much-altered camel’s hump, my jointspoiler, my maymoon’s honey, my fool to the last Decemberer, to wake himself out of his winter’s doze and bore me down like he used to.

Is there irwell a lord of the manor or a knight of the shire at strike, I wonder, that’d dip me a dace or two in cash for washing and darning his worshipful socks for him now we’re run out of horse-brose and milk?

Only for my short Brittas bed made’s as snug as it smells it’s out I’d lep and off with me to the slobs deua Tolka or the plage au Clontarf to feale the gay aire of my salt troublin bay and the race of the saywint up me ambushure.

Onon! Onon! tell me more. Tell me every tiny teign. I want to know every single ingul. Down to what made the potters fly into jagsthole. And why were the vesles vet. That homa fever’s winning me wome. If a mahun of the horse but hard me! We’d be bundukiboi meet askarigal. Well, now comes the hazel-hatchery part. After Clondalkin the Kings’s Inns. We’ll soon be there with the freshet. How many aleveens had she in tool? I can’t rightly rede you that. Close only knows. Some say she had three figures to fill and confined herself to a hundred eleven, wan by-wan bywan, making meanacuminamoyas. Olaph lamm et, all that pack? We won’t have room in the kirkeyaard. She can’t remember half of the cradlenames she smacked on them by the grace of her boxing bishop’s infallible slipper, the cane for Kund and abbles for Eyolf and ayther nayther for Yakov Yea. A hundred and how? They did well to rechristien her Pluhurabelle. O loreley! What a loddon lodes! Heigh ho! But it’s quite on the cards she’ll shed more and merrier, twills and trills, sparefours and spoilfives, nord-sihkes and sudsevers and ayes and neins to a litter. Grandfarthring nap and Messamisery and the knave of all knaves and the joker. Heehaw! She must have been a gadabount in her day, so she must, more than most. Shoal she was, gidgad. She had a flewmen of her owen. Then a toss nare scared that lass, so aimai moe, that’s agapo! Tell me, tell me, how cam she camlin through all her fellows, the neckar she was, the diveline? Casting her perils before our swains from Fonte-inMonte to Tidingtown and from Tidingtown tilhavet. Linking one and knocking the next, tapting a flank and tipting a jutty and palling in and pietaring out and clyding by on her eastway. Waiwhou was the first thur-ever burst? Someone he was, whuebra they were, in a tactic attack or in single combat. Tinker, tilar, souldrer, salor, Pieman Peace or Polistaman. That’s the thing I’m elwys on edge to esk. Push up and push vardar and come to uphill headquarters! Was it waterlows year, after Grattan or Flood, or when maids were in Arc or when three stood hosting? Fidaris will find where the Doubt arises like Nieman from Nirgends found the Nihil. Worry you sighin foh, Albern, O Anser? Untie the gemman’s fistiknots, Qvic and Nuancee! She can’t put her hand on him for the mo-ment. Tez thelon langlo, walking weary! Such a loon waybash — wards to row! She sid herself she hardly knows whuon the annals her graveller was, a dynast of Leinster, a wolf of the sea, or what he did or how blyth she played or how, when, why, where and who offon he jumpnad her and how it was gave her away. She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, sauntering, by silvamoonlake and he was a heavy trudging lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for whose sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, for forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she’s sankh neathe the ground with nymphant shame when he gave her the tigris eye! O happy fault! Me wish it was he! You’re wrong there, corribly wrong! Tisn’t only tonight you’re anacheronistic! It was ages behind that when nullahs were nowhere, in county Wickenlow, garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she’d lave Kilbride and go foaming under Horsepass bridge, with the great southerwestern windstorming her traces and the midland’s grain-waster asarch for her track, to wend her ways byandby, robecca or worse, to spin and to grind, to swab and to thrash, for all her golden lifey in the barleyfields and pennylotts of Humphrey’s fordofhurdlestown and lie with a landleaper, wellingtonorseher. Alesse, the lagos of girly days! For the dove of the dunas! Was-ut? Izod? Are you sarthin suir? Not where the Finn fits into the Mourne, not where the Nore takes lieve of Blþm, not where the Braye divarts the Farer, not where the Moy changez her minds twixt Cullin and Conn tween Cunn and Collin? Or where Neptune sculled and Tritonville rowed and leandros three bumped heroines two? Neya, narev, nen, nonni, nos ! Then whereabouts in Ow and Ovoca? Was it yst with wyst or Lucan Yokan or where the hand of man has never set foot? Dell me where, the fairy ferse time! I will if you listen. You know the dinkel dale of Luggelaw? Well, there once dwelt a local heremite, Michael Arklow was his river-end name, (with many a sigh I aspersed his lavabibs!) and one venersderg in junojuly, oso sweet and so cool and so limber she looked, Nance the Nixie, Nanon L’Escaut, in the silence, of the sy-comores, all listening, the kindling curves you simply can’t stop feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands, the core of his cushlas, in her singimari saffron strumans of hair, parting them and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample like this red bog at sundown. By that Vale Vowclose’s lucydlac, the reignbeau’s heavenarches arronged orranged her. Afroth-dizzying galbs, her enamelled eyes indergoading him on to the vierge violetian. Wish a wish! Why a why? Mavro! Letty Lerck’s lafing light throw those laurals now on her daphdaph teasesong petrock. Maass! But the majik wavus has elfun anon meshes. And Simba the Slayer of his Oga is slewd. He cuddle not help himself, thurso that hot on him, he had to forget the monk in the man so, rubbing her up and smoothing her down, he baised his lippes in smiling mood, kiss akiss after kisokushk (as he warned her niver to, niver to, nevar) on Anna-na-Poghue’s of the freckled forehead. While you’d parse secheressa she hielt her souff’. But she ruz two feet hire in her aisne aestumation. And steppes on stilts ever since. That was kissuahealing with bantur for balm! O, wasn’t he the bold priest? And wasn’t she the naughty Livvy? Nautic Naama’s now her navn. Two lads in scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn and Wallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia’s noblesse pickts, before she had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a birch canoedler not to mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And ere that again, leada, laida, all unraidy, too faint to buoy the fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet’s plume, she was licked by a hound, Chirripa–Chirruta, while poing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil’s glen while Sally her nurse was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillway before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stag-nant black pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.

Drop me the sound of the findhorn’s name, Mtu or Mti, som-bogger was wisness. And drip me why in the flenders was she frickled. And trickle me through was she marcellewaved or was it weirdly a wig she wore. And whitside did they droop their glows in their florry, aback to wist or affront to sea? In fear to hear the dear so near or longing loth and loathing longing? Are you in the swim or are you out? O go in, go on, go an! I mean about what you know. I know right well what you mean. Rother! You’d like the coifs and guimpes, snouty, and me to do the greasy jub on old Veronica’s wipers. What am I rancing now and I’ll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran, where’s your nose? And where’s the starch? That’s not the vesdre bene-diction smell. I can tell from here by their eau de Colo and the scent of her oder they’re Mrs Magrath’s. And you ought to have aird them. They’ve moist come off her. Creases in silk they are, not crampton lawn. Baptiste me, father, for she has sinned! Through her catchment ring she freed them easy, with her hips’ hurrahs for her knees’dontelleries. The only parr with frills in old the plain. So they are, I declare! Welland well! If tomorrow keeps fine who’ll come tripping to sightsee? How’ll? Ask me next what I haven’t got! The Belvedarean exhibitioners. In their cruisery caps and oarsclub colours. What hoo, they band! And what hoa, they buck! And here is her nubilee letters too. Ellis on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flush-caloured field. Annan exe after to show they’re not Laura Ke — own’s. O, may the diabolo twisk your seifety pin! You child of Mammon, Kinsella’s Lilith! Now who has been tearing the leg of her drawars on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where did I stop? Never stop! Continuarration! You’re not there yet. I amstel waiting. Garonne, garonne!

Well, after it was put in the Mericy Cordial Mendicants’ Sitter-dag-Zindeh–Munaday Wakeschrift (for once they sullied their white kidloves, chewing cuds after their dinners of cheeckin and beggin, with their show us it here and their mind out of that and their when you’re quite finished with the reading matarial), even the snee that snowdon his hoaring hair had a skunner against him. Thaw, thaw, sava, savuto! Score Her Chuff Exsquire! Everywhere erriff you went and every bung you arver dropped into, in cit or suburb or in addled areas, the Rose and Bottle or Phoenix Tavern or Power’s Inn or Jude’s Hotel or wherever you scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville or from Porta Lateen to the lootin quarter you found his ikom etsched tipside down or the cornerboys cammocking his guy and Morris the Man, with the role of a royss in his turgos the turrible, (Evro-peahahn cheic house, unskimmed sooit and yahoort, hamman now cheekmee, Ahdahm this way make, Fatima, half tum!) reeling and railing round the local as the peihos piped und uban-jees twanged, with oddfellow’s triple tiara busby rotundarinking round his scalp. Like Pate-by-the-Neva or Pete-over-Meer. This is the Hausman all paven and stoned, that cribbed the Cabin that never was owned that cocked his leg and hennad his Egg. And the mauldrin rabble around him in areopage, fracassing a great bingkan cagnan with their timpan crowders. Mind your Grimm-father! Think of your Ma! Hing the Hong is his jove’s hang — nomen! Lilt a bolero, bulling a law! She swore on croststyx nyne wyndabouts she’s be level with all the snags of them yet. Par the Vulnerable Virgin’s Mary del Dame! So she said to herself she’d frame a plan to fake a shine, the mischiefmaker, the like of it you niever heard. What plan? Tell me quick and dongu so crould! What the meurther did she mague? Well, she bergened a zakbag, a shammy mailsack, with the lend of a loan of the light of his lampion, off one of her swapsons, Shaun the Post, and then she went and consulted her chapboucqs, old Mot Moore, Casey’s Euclid and the Fashion Display and made herself tidal to join in the mascarete. O gig goggle of gigguels. I can’t tell you how! It’s too screaming to rizo, rabbit it all! Minneha, minnehi mina-aehe, minneho! O but you must, you must really! Make my hear it gurgle gurgle, like the farest gargle gargle in the dusky dirgle dargle! By the holy well of Mulhuddart I swear I’d pledge my chanza getting to heaven through Tirry and Killy’s mount of impiety to hear it all, aviary word! O, leave me my faculties, woman, a while! If you don’t like my story get out of the punt. Well, have it your own way, so. Here, sit down and do as you’re bid. Take my stroke and bend to your bow. Forward in and pull your overthepoise! Lisp it slaney and crisp it quiet. Deel me long-some. Tongue your time now. Breathe thet deep. Thouat’s the fairway. Hurry slow and scheldt you go. Lynd us your blessed ashes here till I scrub the canon’s underpants. Flow now. Ower more. And pooleypooley.

First she let her hair fal and down it flussed to her feet its teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she sampood herself with galawater and fraguant pistania mud, wupper and lauar, from crown to sole. Next she greesed the groove of her keel, warthes and wears and mole and itcher, with antifouling butter-scatch and turfentide and serpenthyme and with leafmould she ushered round prunella isles and eslats dun, quincecunct, allover her little mary. Peeld gold of waxwork her jellybelly and her grains of incense anguille bronze. And after that she wove a gar-land for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen griefs of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and her anklets and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and rehr, of Irish rhunerhinerstones and shellmarble bangles. That done, a dawk of smut to her airy ey, Annushka Lutetiavitch Pufflovah, and the lellipos cream to her lippeleens and the pick of the paintbox for her pommettes, from strawbirry reds to extra violates, and she sendred her boudeloire maids to His Affluence, Ciliegia Grande and Kirschie Real, the two chirsines, with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request might she passe of him for a minnikin. A call to pay and light a taper, in Brie-on-Arrosa, back in a sprizzling. The cock striking mine, the stalls bridely sign, there’s Zambosy waiting for Me! She said she wouldn’t be half her length away. Then, then, as soon as the lump his back was turned, with her mealiebag slang over her shulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, forth of her bassein came.

Describe her! Hustle along, why can’t you? Spitz on the iern while it’s hot. I wouldn’t miss her for irthing on nerthe. Not for the lucre of lomba strait. Oceans of Gaud, I mosel hear that! Ogowe presta! Leste, before Julia sees her! Ishekarry and washe-meskad, the carishy caratimaney? Whole lady fair? Duodecimo — roon? Bon a ventura? Malagassy? What had she on, the liddel oud oddity? How much did she scallop, harness and weights? Here she is, Amnisty Ann! Call her calamity electrifies man.

No electress at all but old Moppa Necessity, angin mother of injons. I’ll tell you a test. But you must sit still. Will you hold your peace and listen well to what I am going to say now? It might have been ten or twenty to one of the night of Allclose or the nexth of April when the flip of her hoogly igloo flappered and out toetippit a bushman woman, the dearest little moma ever you saw, nodding around her, all smiles, with ems of embarras and aues to awe, between two ages, a judyqueen, not up to your elb. Quick, look at her cute and saise her quirk for the bicker she lives the slicker she grows. Save us and tagus! No more? Werra where in ourthe did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a battering ram? Ay, you’re right. I’m epte to forgetting, Like Liviam Liddle did Loveme Long. The linth of my hough, I say! She wore a ploughboy’s nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak and a band of gorse for an arnoment and a hundred streamers dancing off it and a guildered pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled her eyes: and a fishnetzeveil for the sun not to spoil the wrinklings of her hydeaspects: potatorings boucled the loose laubes of her laudsnarers: her nude cuba stockings were salmospotspeckled: she sported a galligo shimmy of hazevaipar tinto that never was fast till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined her length: her bloodorange bockknickers, a two in one garment, showed natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her black-stripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush; she had a clothes-peg tight astride on her joki’s nose and she kep on grinding a sommething quaint in her fiumy mouth and the rrreke of the fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler’s skirt trailed ffiffty odd Irish miles behind her lungarhodes.

Hellsbells, I’m sorry I missed her! Sweet gumptyum and no-body fainted! But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? Everyone that saw her said the dowce little delia looked a bit queer. Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Missus, be good and don’t fol in the say! Fenny poor hex she must have charred. Kickhams a frumpier ever you saw! Making mush mullet’s eyes at her boys dobelon. And they crowned her their chariton queen, all the maids. Of the may? You don’t say! Well for her she couldn’t see herself. I recknitz wharfore the darling murrayed her mirror. She did? Mersey me! There was a koros of drouthdropping sur- facemen, boomslanging and plugchewing, fruiteyeing and flower-feeding, in contemplation of the fluctuation and the undification of her filimentation, lolling and leasing on North Lazers’ Waal all eelfare week by the Jukar Yoick’s and as soon as they saw her meander by that marritime way in her grasswinter’s weeds and twigged who was under her archdeaconess bonnet, Avondale’s fish and Clarence’s poison, sedges an to aneber, Wit-upon-Crutches to Master Bates: Between our two southsates and the granite they’re warming, or her face has been lifted or Alp has doped!

But what was the game in her mixed baggyrhatty? Just the tembo in her tumbo or pilipili from her pepperpot? Saas and taas and specis bizaas. And where in thunder did she plunder? Fore the battle or efter the ball? I want to get it frisk from the soorce. I aubette my bearb it’s worth while poaching on! Shake it up, do, do! That’s a good old son of a ditch! I promise I’ll make it worth your while. And I don’t mean maybe. Nor yet with a goodfor. Spey me pruth and I’ll tale you true.

Well, arundgirond in a waveney lyne aringarouma she pattered and swung and sidled, dribbling her boulder through narrowa mosses, the diliskydrear on our drier side and the vilde vetchvine agin us, curara here, careero there, not knowing which medway or weser to strike it, edereider, making chattahoochee all to her ain chichiu, like Santa Claus at the cree of the pale and puny, nistling to hear for their tiny hearties, her arms encircling Isola-bella, then running with reconciled Romas and Reims, on like a lech to be off like a dart, then bathing Dirty Hans’ spatters with spittle, with a Christmas box apiece for aisch and iveryone of her childer, the birthday gifts they dreamt they gabe her, the spoiled she fleetly laid at our door! On the matt, by the pourch and inunder the cellar. The rivulets ran aflod to see, the glashaboys, the pollynooties. Out of the paunschaup on to the pyre. And they all about her, juvenile leads and ingenuinas, from the slime of their slums and artesaned wellings, rickets and riots, like the Smyly boys at their vicereine’s levee. Vivi vienne, little Annchen! Vielo Anna, high life! Sing us a sula, O, susuria! Ausone sidulcis! Hasn’t she tambre! Chipping her and raising a bit of a chir or a jary every dive she’d neb in her culdee sacco of wabbash she raabed and reach out her maundy meerschaundize, poor souvenir as per ricorder and all for sore aringarung, stinkers and heelers, laggards and primelads, her furzeborn sons and dribblederry daughters, a thousand and one of them, and wickerpotluck for each of them.

She gave them ilcka madre’s daughter a moonflower and a bloodvein: but the grapes that ripe before reason to them that devide the vinedress. So on Izzy, her shame-maid, love shone befond her tears as from Shem, her penmight, life past befoul his prime.

Sudds for me and supper for you and the doctor’s bill for Joe John. Befor! Bifur! He married his markets, cheap by foul, I know, like any Etrurian Catholic Heathen, in their pinky limony creamy birnies and their turkiss indienne mauves. But at milkidmass who was the spouse? Then all that was was fair. Tys Elvenland! Teems of times and happy returns. The seim anew. Ordovico or viricordo. Anna was, Livia is, Plurabelle’s to be.

(Kennerly/Robbins)

She was sitting cross-legged on a hood of a Ford
Filing down her nails with a emory board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do

When she said, ""You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that.""
Betty said, ""I've seen him at the hardware store
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure.""

And as they talked a little while he passed by
She smiled at him he just said ""Hi.""
He was thinking to himself as he walked away
Man, I'd like to find a girl like her someday

(Chorus)
Young love, strong love, true love
It's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
Walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love

Well, she just couldn't stop herself from thinking 'bout him
And at a store downtown she saw him again
She had both hands full, he held open the door
He said, ""My name is Billy. I've seen you before

Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on a Saturday night?""
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside
He could see the answer shining in her eyes

(Chorus)
Well, from that day on you couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side, heart to heart
Mama cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born she was crying again

Well, he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave

(Chorus)
She was sitting cross-legged on the hood of a Ford
Filing down her nails with an emory board

1428,Gene Watson,32,Back In The Fire,1989,"

My mind knows full well I should leave here
But my heart, my foolish heart will not turn
She fills me with a crazy wild desire
And, lying helpless, I know just how I'll burn

Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so then why oh why does it keep draggin' me
Back in the fire to the flames of extacsy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me

At times I've gone as far as believing
This tortured soul of mine was finally free
Then those long silent leftover feelings
Say I'm a pretender and I'll surrender willingly

Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so then why oh why does it keep draggin' me
Back in the fire to the flames of extacsy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me

[Verse 1]
This old highway's gettin' longer
It seems there is no end in sight
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night

[Verse 2]
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long

[Chorus]
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Verse 2]
The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all

[Chorus]
And the white line's gettin' longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

[Outro]
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old

(Mike Reid / Kent Robbins)

There's a million oil rigs pumping
That black gold all over the world
Sheiks and cowboy billionaires
In limousines loaded with sparkling girls
But money can't buy happiness
Just listen to the stories they tell
All you need to really suceed in life
Is one good well

It takes one good well
Deep and ever-flowing
One good well
To draw from night and day
Pure and fine, it's yours and mine
And it's, always enough
We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love

--- Instrumental ---

Don't it seem kinda funny
How people with a lot of money
Only hunger for more
You think they'd learn
That money can burn
It's love that keeps
The wolf from the door
Precious love lies deep inside
Hearts you can't buy and sell
When the money's low
Still we know we got
One good well

It takes one good well
Deep and ever-flowing
One good well
To draw from night and day
Pure and fine, it's yours and mine
And it's, always enough
We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love

We've got one good well
Overflowing with everlasting love...

Dear me
I'm writin' this letter to try and tell myself
It's time for me to feel better

Dear me
How could I turn away when he needed me
Now all that's left to say is ""dear me""
Oh, what have I done
Oh, and dear me
He's my only one
If he could see me now
Sittin' here all alone
If he could read these words
Would he run back home
Dear me

Dear me
Do you really mind
You're the only friend
Who will take the time to hear me
Oh, and all the plans we've made
If he'll take me back
I'll do anything to make him stay
Oh, dear me
We'll start all over again
Oh, and dear me
I hope he'll stay 'til the end
If he could see me now
Sittin' here all alone
If he could read these words
Would he run back home
Dear me

Dear me
We'll start all over again
Oh, and dear me
I hope he'll stay 'til the end

1433,Chris Hillman & Roger McGuinn,37,You Ain't Going Nowhere,1989,
1434,Dolly Parton,38,Why'd You Come In Here Lookin' Like That,1989,"

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?

Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy, who says love is blind?
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that

I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a soft-hearted woman, he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your high heel boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?

Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
Why'd you come in here looking like that?

1437,George Jones,41,The King Is Gone (So Are You),1989,"

Last night I broke the seal on a Jim Beam decanter
That looks like Elvis
I soaked the label off a Flintstone Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that
One little table that you left us
And pulled me up a big ole piece of floor
I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

'Round about ten we all got to talking
'Bout Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much
Elvis said, ""Find 'em young.""
And Fred said, ""Old Fashioned girls are fun.""
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

Later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no more
Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before
Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pouring the last drop from his toes
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

1439,The Statler Brothers,43,More Than A Name On A Wall,1989,"

I saw her from a distance
As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall
And she took out pen and paper
As to trace her memories
And she looked up to heaven
And the words she said were these...

She said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see
All I have are the memories
And the moments to recall

So Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

She said he really missed the family
And being home on Christmas day
And he died for God and Country
In a place so far away

I remember just a little boy
Playing war since he was three
But Lord this time I know
He's not coming home to me

And she said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
But I know it just can't be
So I thank you for my memories
And the moments to recall

But Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

1440,Emmylou Harris,44,Heaven Only Knows,1989,"

[Verse 1]
Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees, how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but heaven only knows

[Verse 2]
I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Till I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows

1441,The Charlie Daniels Band,45,Midnight Train,1989,"

[Chorus]
Midnight train, roll on
Midnight train, roll on

[Verse 1]
Clear them tracks and keep that whistle blowin
Take this stranger on to Santa Fe
It seems like romance and danger
Follow this here tall dark stranger all along the way
Well the train was rumbling through the night heading south to Santa Fe
And in a fancy car, with a private bar, and a personal valet
There was a bunch of cold eyed men a sittin at a poker table
Betting hot stakes all around
Ole Louisiana Lou had a knife in his shoe, was dealing a hand of cards
And ole Stagger Lee Crocket had a gun in his pocket, was sweatin bettin hard
And over in the corner this Mexican guy with two gold teeth and a patch on his eye
Took a long hard look around
And then the door flew open, the stranger walked in and said don't ya'll get excited
I know this here's a private game, and I know I wasn't invited
But I got a roll that'd choke a mule
I'm just about a big enough fool to lay it all right down
And everybody nodded as the stranger took his seat
He knew this bunch of cutthroat's would be mighty hard to beat
As the stranger knew then the toughest two by far were where he sat
Was a pot belly fellow from south Alabama, and a dude in a black felt hat

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well clear them tracks and keep that whistle blowin
Take this stranger on to Santa Fe
It seems like romance and danger
Follow this here tall dark stranger all along the way
Well the stranger sat down he looked around at all them evil faces
And the pot-belly fellow drew a pair of queens, but the stranger he drew aces
And he kept on raising and pushin his luck, kept on winning like a run away truck
He was giving them a beating
And the stakes got higher than a Chinese kite, the stranger kept getting hot
Till every cent everybody had was lying out in that pot
Then the stranger threw down a royal flush
Somebody said ""Hey Man, that's enough friend I think you've been cheating""
And then the stranger picked the money up and said ""Boys I better run""
And then the bot-bellyed fella pulled a razor out and somebody pulled a gun
They said ""You may think you're a sly old fox
You're gonna leave here in a long pine box
If you don't leave that money alone""
Just about then the lights went out, and they all started fussing
And the lights came on, the stranger was gone, they all started cussin
And they searched that train from front to rear
The stranger he done disappeared, and all their money was gone
When the train pulled in the station, with the whistle blowing loud
A telegram was waitin, from the stranger for the crowd
Said ""Thank you for the money boys, but don't feel too outdone
Cause It takes a dog to know a dog
I'm a howlin son of a gun.""

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well clear them tracks and keep that whistle blowin
Take this stranger on to Santa Fe
It seems like romance and danger
Follow this here tall dark stranger all along the way

Well that's a real nice jacket son, it looks like it cost you too
And that car you're driving hey, does that belong to you?
Well you don't look familiar, are you new in town?
Here's a local girl who wants to show you around
How do?

Where'd you get that accent son, it matches your cowboy boots
Tonight those lone star ladies must be lonesome and oh so blue
Because we're a thousand miles from the Texas line
If you've no objection son tonight you're mine
How do?

Well I've been to Paris baby, I've been to Dallas too
But I didn't see no one there who looked half as good as you
So if you ain't in a hurry baby, just sit tight
I'm sort of in the mood to speak some French tonight
Et vous?
How do?

1443,Patty Loveless,47,Don't Toss Us Away,1989,"

Well it seems that everyone we know
The loves grown cold, while ours stand the storm
One by one they break, it's such a shame
And now you say you want to do the same

Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly
It just ain't right, oh can't you see?
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

Well just think of all that we been through
The world we're building..me and you
How could all those years be tossed away
In just one moment, in just one day

Don't toss us away, it just ain't right
To let love die without a fight
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please don't toss us away

So now I'm asking once again
To understand, to be my friend
Oh it hurts so bad to think you'd go
But still the same, I love you so

Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly
It just ain't right, oh can't you see?
I still love you, I want you to stay
Darlin please, don't toss us away

Oh darlin please
Don't toss us away

1444,Baillie And The Boys,48,She Deserves You,1989,"

You say
She deserves you more than me
You say
She's the kind of woman I could never be

Cause she can make you feel
The way I did in my younger days
When our love was new
Well, she don't know you like I do

And if she wants a man
Who'll take the ring off of his hand
And then turn around
And say that he'll be true
Then she deserves you

You promise her the moon
And she believes
She's innocent and trusting just like I used to be

You say
That when you hold her
You forget that you've grown older
And that might be true
But she don't know you like I do

And if she wants a man
Who'll take the ring off of his hand
And then turn around
And say that he'll be true
Then she deserves you

Remember when you tell her
That you'll stay with her forever
There was a time you said those words to me

And if she wants a man
Who'll take the ring off of his hand
And then turn around
And say that he'll be true
Then she deserves you

And if she wants a man
Who'll take the ring off of his hand
And then turn around
And say that he'll be true
Then she deserves you

In the country with me?
I'm celebratin' ya see the four-wheeled beauty
You're leanin' on it finally belongs to me

I've never owned a car before
And I've never picked a boy up at his own front door
It'd be a red letter day
If you'll come out and play in the country with me

Hey Bobby will you ride a little ways down 299
To a lovely little spot I found? It's on a hilltop
We can park in the shade and dance on the ground
To a radio station where the hits don't ever stop

Watch the sun go down, see the moon rise up
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup
Rock the night away, lookin' at stars
Talkin' 'bout cars Bobby, with me

Hey Bobby do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Huh?

Watch the sun go down, see the moon rise up
Drink a champagne toast in a plastic cup
In future times that be
When ya need a good memory, Bobby think about me

Hey, Bobby do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?
Do ya wanna huh? Do ya wanna huh? Huh?

Walkin' away I saw a side of you
That I knew was there all along
And that someday I'd say goodbye to you
'Cause one right can still make two wrong

Not for each other, not from the start
The difference was day and night
My finest hour spent here with you in the dark
Was just before I saw the light

It's the people who want love and
The people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin away

Now that I know what I'm tryin' to find
There's only one place it could be
So I'm lookin' ahead, I've stopped lookin' behind
For someone who's lookin' for me

It's the people who want love and
The people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin away

1448,Ricky Van Shelton,2,I've Cried My Last Tear For You,1990,"

When you left me lonely here
I thought that I would drown in tears
As one was wiped away
Another one would take its place
Drop by drop, as time went by
I slowly ran that river dry
Until I finally realized today

That I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
It's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you

Well, I used to lay alone in bed
With my pillow soaking wet
And all of those lonely nights
I thought there was no end in sight
I cried my heart out over you
But then I cried the hurt out too
It took a while, but now I'll be alright

But I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
Well, it's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you
Yes, baby, I've cried my last tear for you

"
1449,Keith Whitley,3,I'm Over You,1990,"

Where there's a cloud, don't mean there's rain
Tears in my eyes, don't mean there's pain
Don't flatter yourself
I'm over you

Things aren't always what they seem
You can't believe everything you read
On my face
I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
Why they making those stories up
When I'm over you

There were times that if you'd been around
You would have seen me broken down
But now you won't
I'm over you

So if I seem a little bit cold
It only means you've lost the hold
You had on me
I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
But why they making those stories up
When I'm over you

You heard I'm drinking more than I should
That I ain't been looking all that good
Someone told you I was taking it rough
But why they making those stories up
When I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you

1450,Doug Stone,4,I'd Be Better Off (In A Pine Box),1990,"

I said the night you left me
Nothin' worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons , I had for hanging on
I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I always thought that someday
We might get back together
I just thought you needed time to spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

Girl I'd be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back from Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind

I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind

1451,George Strait,5,Love Without End  Amen,1990,"

[Verse 1]
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
And then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

[Chorus]
And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us”
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen""

[Verse 2]
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again

[Chorus]

Just sit down and talk to me awhile
I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'
But I guess I must've missed it by a mile

[Verse 2]
Well this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
Help me understand where I went wrong
It's hard to find myself in this position
Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

[Chorus]
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

[Verse 3]
What have I got to do to make it better
What have I got to do to make you see
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

[Verse 4]
I realize I took your love for granted
But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you
Satisfied and stayin' here with me

[Chorus]
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

I had a six-transistor when I was a kid
Under my pillow I kept it hid
When the lights went out and no one could see
Over the airwaves the world came to me

[Verse 2]
I'd go through the stations 'til I found a game
I knew how they played by the sounds of their names
The sluggers hit homers, those pitchers threw smoke
And I watched it all on my radio

[Chorus]
At the crack of the bat, I knew how far it'd go
And I watched it all on my radio
I watched it all on my radio

[Verse 3]
When the ball game was over, the wrap-up complete
I'd search through the static 'til I found a beat
The Beatles and Creedence, the Stones and the Byrds
You should have seen all the groups that I heard

[Verse 4]
And on Saturday night, when the skies were all clear
A station from Nashville sometimes would appear
The steel guitars and soft Southern twang
The stars of the Grand Ole Opry would sing

[Chorus]
And I had a seat on the very front row
And I watched it all on my radio
I watched it all on my radio

[Verse 5]
And right about midnight, some preacher came on
To tell me what's right, to tell me what's wrong
And there was that test at the sound of the beep
It was only a test, the voice would repeat
And the National Anthem would sing me to sleep

[Verse 6]
I had a six-transistor when I was a kid
Under my pillow I kept it hid
When the lights went out and no one could see
Over the airwaves the world came to me

We live in the land of plenty
But many things aren't plenty anymore
Like the water from our sink
They say its not safe to drink
You gotta go and buy it at the store
Now we're told there's a hole in the ozone
Look what's washing on the beach
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees

So let's leave some blue up above us
Let's leave some green on the ground
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow
Leave it and pass it on down

Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains
Acid rain is falling on the leaves
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still
How we gonna breathe without them trees

So let's leave some blue up above us
Let's leave some green on the ground
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow
Leave it and pass it on down

There's a place where I live called the Canyon
Where Daddy taught me to swim
And that water, it's so pure
And I'm gonna make sure
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him

Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty
When we look into the eyes of our kids
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back
They'll have to pay for all we did

So let's leave some blue up above us
Let's leave some green on the ground
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow
Leave it and pass it on down

So let's leave some blue up above us (above us)
Let's leave some green on the ground (on the ground)
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow
Leave it and pass it on down

1456,Steve Wariner,10,The Domino Theory,1990,"

I like livin in the land of free
And I like how it feels when you lean on me
Ever since you wandered into my back yard
I dropped my resistance and lowered my guard

You got the pieces of my heart all in a row
Knock one down and thw whole thing goes
It's the domino theory of love
It only takes a shove

I fall you fall
We gotta keep our defenses up
That's the domino theory of love
The game of romance is a balancing act
It's two step forward and one step back

Take a little liberty give a little ground
Next thing you know we'll be sliding on down
When it comes to sortin out our hearts and our minds
We're just a couple of pushovers standing in line

It's the domino theory of love
It only takes a shove
I fall you fall
We gotta keep our defenses up

That's the domino theory of love

Solo

When it comes to sortin out our hearts and our minds
We're just a couple of pushovers standing in line

We gotta keep our defenses up
Or we'll all go down together
It only takes a shove

I fall you fall
We gotta keep our defenses up

1457,Rodney Crowell,11,If Looks Could Kill,1990,"

If today weren't just like any day perhaps I'd try
To shed this worn out skin so thick and learn to fly
But I came home to face your ice and steel
If looks could kill I would be gone today
There's a fire that's burning in your eyes not in your heart
I can fan the fames but I can't make a spark
I don't like the way I make you feel
If looks could kill I would be long since gone
If looks could kill then I'd be pushing up your daisies
If looks could kill then I would not be going crazy
There's a stool that I've been glued to for so many nights
And a bar to pour my heart out to and make it right
And I don't have to tell myself it's real
If looks could kill my heart would beat no more
If looks could kill then I'd be deep in peaceful slumber
If looks could kill then I would not be going under
There's a gun out in the hallway covered up in dust
That works well enough to turn a heartache into dust
Go on and let your lawyer make a deal
If looks could kill
If looks could kill
I would be long since gone

Can fall apart sometimes

Pick yourself up off the ground and

Walk on
Walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on
Oh, walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light until you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
And walk on

But even though your heart breaks
You know it's going to mend
Keep the faith right through goodbye
And don't you ever break your stride

1460,Kathy Mattea,14,She Came From Fort Worth,1990,"

[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
She was workin' at a diner just a week ago
When a man from Colorado smiled and said, ""hello""
And he turned her head with stories about a cabin in the trees
Where the wind can sing you love songs
Beneath snow-capped mountain peaks

[Verse 2]
Now she's packed her faded jeans and her favorite cowboy boots
Left her apron at the diner for someone else to use
One last look in the mirror at the girl she used to be
Then the driver takes her ticket and she tries to fall asleep

[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Verse 3]
And somewhere in the long, dark night, the snow began to fall
Oh, the world outside was sparkling white when she heard the driver call
""Everyone off now for Boulder and have a real nice day""
He was waitin' on the platform and he raised his hand to wave

[Bridge]
And she offered no resistance as he took her to his cabin
And that diner in the distance seemed just like it never happened

[Chorus]
She came from Fort Worth, Fort Worth couldn't hold her
Her dreams were bigger than the Texas sky
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye

[Tag]
She's got a one-way ticket on the next bus for Boulder
And it won't take long to say goodbye, bye bye

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmie Rodgers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin', baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow, southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis, the music's like a heat wave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
*Love Me Tender* leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Hill-Hillman

It would take another lifetime
To see what I have done
Have I lived through the best times
Have I hurt anyone

Just to do it all over
Make it all rhyme
Like a book with no cover
Like a page out of time

If I had another lifetime
If I had another day
I might have walked a straighter line
I might have known what to say
In another lifetime
In another day
If I say what's on my mind
Would you love me anyway

Started walkin' down a one-way-street
Now I can't return
Ain't nobody's comin' after me
This is the lesson I learned

I'm no stranger to the bad times
I'll just stand my ground
And remember that the good times
Don't always come back around

A hundred year old photograph
Stares out from a frame
And if you look real close you'll see
Our eyes are just the same
I never met them face to face
But I still know them well
From the stories
My dear grandma would tell

Elijah was a farmer
He knew how to make things grow
Fannie vowed she'd follow him
Wherever he would go
As things turned out they never left
Their small Kentucky farm
But he kept her fed
She kept him warm

(Chorus)
They're my guardian angels
And I know they can see
Ev'ry step I take
They are watching over me
I might not know where I'm goin'
But I'm sure where I come from
They're my guardian angels
And I'm their special one

Sometimes when I'm tired
I feel Elijah take my arm
He says, ""Keep a-goin', hard work
Never did a body harm.""
And when I'm really troubled
And I don't know what to do
Fannie whispers, ""Just do your best, We're awful proud of you!""

Stares out from a frame
And if you look real close you'll see

Big wheels spinnin'
On the blacktop
I feel like
I never will stop

Let 'em roll
Until I drop
Rollin' all night and day

I can't get nothin'
On the radio
I listen
To the windshield wipers go

Just like the song
I used to know
I'm drivin' my life away, hey
Drivin' my life away

I'm just runnin' with the wind
Hell on wheels
Pedal to the metal
Drivin' into the black of night again

I'm just runnin' with the wind
One bad machine
Mean ol' Mack
We've seen a lot of black track
Runnin' with the wind

Pretty little girl in Amarillo
She looks like
She knows every way to go
Well, I just said, baby, El Paso

There's more than big wheels
Goin' around, you know
She said don't worry, baby
'Cause you're gonna be fine
I'll get you down the road
In plenty of time

I'm better for you
Than that white line
That you've been chasin' around
And around, and around
And around, and around

I'm just runnin' with the wind
Hell on wheels
Pedal to the metal
Drivin' into the black of night again

I'm just runnin' with the wind
One fine machine
Mean ol' Mack
We've seen a lot of black track
Runnin' with the wind

Run it down

I'm just runnin' with the wind
Hell on wheels
Pedal to the metal
Drivin' into the black of night again

I'm just runnin' with the wind
One bad machine
Mean ol' Mack
We've seen a lot of black track
Runnin' with the wind

I'm just runnin', runnin' with the wind
Runnin', runnin' with the wind

I'm just runnin', runnin'

Every Sunday found him there
At the Lighthouse Gospel Church
With his hands folded in prayer
And standin' right beside him
Was his pretty hometown bride
But no one could have guessed
What he was prayin' deep inside

Dancy has a demon
Livin' Somewhere in his past
That dark-haired Cajun angel
Was the devil dressed in black
Was it really voodoo
Or just weakness in the man
The only time he ever fell
Was when she took his hand

Oh It's been so long, but it's still so strong
Every night the devil comes and walks through Dancy's dream
She takes him by the hand and leads him back to New Orleans
A good man's goin' crazy somewhere in between
The hymns on Sunday mornin' and the sins in Dancy's dream

Sometimes it's almost like
He was never even there
But other times he swears he smells
The flowers in her hair
He never told his secret
No one would understand
She's the only one who's seen
The dark side of the man

I keep talking to your picture
But a smile is all you say
It's a lonely conversation
But missing you is easier this way

Last night a shadow filled the doorway
And I heard footsteps on the stairs
Then I woke up this morning
And thought I saw you standing there

Stranger things have happened
And I'll always believe
If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

One touch is worth a thousand pictures
What might have been ain't worth a dime
I just hope someday I'll hold you
Another place, some other time

Stranger things have happened
And I'll always believe
If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

If stranger things can happen
You could still come back to me

Stranger things have happened...

DISCOURSES OF RAPHAEL HYTHLODAY, OF THE BEST STATE OF A COMMONWEALTH

Henry VIII., the unconquered King of England, a prince adorned with all the virtues that become a great monarch, having some differences of no small consequence with Charles the most serene Prince of Castile, sent me into Flanders, as his ambassador, for treating and composing matters between them. I was colleague and companion to that incomparable man Cuthbert Tonstal, whom the King, with such universal applause, lately made Master of the Rolls; but of whom I will say nothing; not because I fear that the testimony of a friend will be suspected, but rather because his learning and virtues are too great for me to do them justice, and so well known, that they need not my commendations, unless I would, according to the proverb, “Show the sun with a lantern.” Those that were appointed by the Prince to treat with us, met us at Bruges, according to agreement; they were all worthy men. The Margrave of Bruges was their head, and the chief man among them; but he that was esteemed the wisest, and that spoke for the rest, was George Temse, the Provost of Casselsee: both art and nature had concurred to make him eloquent: he was very learned in the law; and, as he had a great capacity, so, by a long practice in affairs, he was very dexterous at unravelling them. After we had several times met, without coming to an agreement, they went to Brussels for some days, to know the Prince’s pleasure; and, since our business would admit it, I went to Antwerp. While I was there, among many that visited me, there was one that was more acceptable to me than any other, Peter Giles, born at Antwerp, who is a man of great honour, and of a good rank in his town, though less than he deserves; for I do not know if there be anywhere to be found a more learned and a better bred young man; for as he is both a very worthy and a very knowing person, so he is so civil to all men, so particularly kind to his friends, and so full of candour and affection, that there is not, perhaps, above one or two anywhere to be found, that is in all respects so perfect a friend: he is extraordinarily modest, there is no artifice in him, and yet no man has more of a prudent simplicity. His conversation was so pleasant and so innocently cheerful, that his company in a great measure lessened any longings to go back to my country, and to my wife and children, which an absence of four months had quickened very much. One day, as I was returning home from mass at St. Mary’s, which is the chief church, and the most frequented of any in Antwerp, I saw him, by accident, talking with a stranger, who seemed past the flower of his age; his face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging carelessly about him, so that, by his looks and habit, I concluded he was a seaman. As soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me, and as I was returning his civility, he took me aside, and pointing to him with whom he had been discoursing, he said, “Do you see that man? I was just thinking to bring him to you.” I answered, “He should have been very welcome on your account.” “And on his own too,” replied he, “if you knew the man, for there is none alive that can give so copious an account of unknown nations and countries as he can do, which I know you very much desire.” “Then,” said I, “I did not guess amiss, for at first sight I took him for a seaman.” “But you are much mistaken,” said he, “for he has not sailed as a seaman, but as a traveller, or rather a philosopher. This Raphael, who from his family carries the name of Hythloday, is not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but is eminently learned in the Greek, having applied himself more particularly to that than to the former, because he had given himself much to philosophy, in which he knew that the Romans have left us nothing that is valuable, except what is to be found in Seneca and Cicero. He is a Portuguese by birth, and was so desirous of seeing the world, that he divided his estate among his brothers, ran the same hazard as Americus Vesputius, and bore a share in three of his four voyages that are now published; only he did not return with him in his last, but obtained leave of him, almost by force, that he might be one of those twenty-four who were left at the farthest place at which they touched in their last voyage to New Castile. The leaving him thus did not a little gratify one that was more fond of travelling than of returning home to be buried in his own country; for he used often to say, that the way to heaven was the same from all places, and he that had no grave had the heavens still over him. Yet this disposition of mind had cost him dear, if God had not been very gracious to him; for after he, with five Castalians, had travelled over many countries, at last, by strange good fortune, he got to Ceylon, and from thence to Calicut, where he, very happily, found some Portuguese ships; and, beyond all men’s expectations, returned to his native country.” When Peter had said this to me, I thanked him for his kindness in intending to give me the acquaintance of a man whose conversation he knew would be so acceptable; and upon that Raphael and I embraced each other. After those civilities were past which are usual with strangers upon their first meeting, we all went to my house, and entering into the garden, sat down on a green bank and entertained one another in discourse. He told us that when Vesputius had sailed away, he, and his companions that stayed behind in New Castile, by degrees insinuated themselves into the affections of the people of the country, meeting often with them and treating them gently; and at last they not only lived among them without danger, but conversed familiarly with them, and got so far into the heart of a prince, whose name and country I have forgot, that he both furnished them plentifully with all things necessary, and also with the conveniences of travelling, both boats when they went by water, and waggons when they trained over land: he sent with them a very faithful guide, who was to introduce and recommend them to such other princes as they had a mind to see: and after many days’ journey, they came to towns, and cities, and to commonwealths, that were both happily governed and well peopled. Under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as the sun moves, there lay vast deserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of the sun; the soil was withered, all things looked dismally, and all places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and serpents, and some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a new scene opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more verdant, and even the beasts were less wild: and, at last, there were nations, towns, and cities, that had not only mutual commerce among themselves and with their neighbours, but traded, both by sea and land, to very remote countries. There they found the conveniencies of seeing many countries on all hands, for no ship went any voyage into which he and his companions were not very welcome. The first vessels that they saw were flat-bottomed, their sails were made of reeds and wicker, woven close together, only some were of leather; but, afterwards, they found ships made with round keels and canvas sails, and in all respects like our ships, and the seamen understood both astronomy and navigation. He got wonderfully into their favour by showing them the use of the needle, of which till then they were utterly ignorant. They sailed before with great caution, and only in summer time; but now they count all seasons alike, trusting wholly to the loadstone, in which they are, perhaps, more secure than safe; so that there is reason to fear that this discovery, which was thought would prove so much to their advantage, may, by their imprudence, become an occasion of much mischief to them. But it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observed in every place, it would be too great a digression from our present purpose: whatever is necessary to be told concerning those wise and prudent institutions which he observed among civilised nations, may perhaps be related by us on a more proper occasion. We asked him many questions concerning all these things, to which he answered very willingly; we made no inquiries after monsters, than which nothing is more common; for everywhere one may hear of ravenous dogs and wolves, and cruel men-eaters, but it is not so easy to find states that are well and wisely governed.

As he told us of many things that were amiss in those new-discovered countries, so he reckoned up not a few things, from which patterns might be taken for correcting the errors of these nations among whom we live; of which an account may be given, as I have already promised, at some other time; for, at present, I intend only to relate those particulars that he told us, of the manners and laws of the Utopians: but I will begin with the occasion that led us to speak of that commonwealth. After Raphael had discoursed with great judgment on the many errors that were both among us and these nations, had treated of the wise institutions both here and there, and had spoken as distinctly of the customs and government of every nation through which he had past, as if he had spent his whole life in it, Peter, being struck with admiration, said, “I wonder, Raphael, how it comes that you enter into no king’s service, for I am sure there are none to whom you would not be very acceptable; for your learning and knowledge, both of men and things, is such, that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly, but be of great use to them, by the examples you could set before them, and the advices you could give them; and by this means you would both serve your own interest, and be of great use to all your friends.” “As for my friends,” answered he, “I need not be much concerned, having already done for them all that was incumbent on me; for when I was not only in good health, but fresh and young, I distributed that among my kindred and friends which other people do not part with till they are old and sick: when they then unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves. I think my friends ought to rest contented with this, and not to expect that for their sakes I should enslave myself to any king whatsoever.” “Soft and fair!” said Peter; “I do not mean that you should be a slave to any king, but only that you should assist them and be useful to them.” “The change of the word,” said he, “does not alter the matter.” “But term it as you will,” replied Peter, “I do not see any other way in which you can be so useful, both in private to your friends and to the public, and by which you can make your own condition happier.” “Happier?” answered Raphael, “is that to be compassed in a way so abhorrent to my genius? Now I live as I will, to which I believe, few courtiers can pretend; and there are so many that court the favour of great men, that there will be no great loss if they are not troubled either with me or with others of my temper.” Upon this, said I, “I perceive, Raphael, that you neither desire wealth nor greatness; and, indeed, I value and admire such a man much more than I do any of the great men in the world. Yet I think you would do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul as yours is, if you would apply your time and thoughts to public affairs, even though you may happen to find it a little uneasy to yourself; and this you can never do with so much advantage as by being taken into the council of some great prince and putting him on noble and worthy actions, which I know you would do if you were in such a post; for the springs both of good and evil flow from the prince over a whole nation, as from a lasting fountain. So much learning as you have, even without practice in affairs, or so great a practice as you have had, without any other learning, would render you a very fit counsellor to any king whatsoever.” “You are doubly mistaken,” said he, “Mr. More, both in your opinion of me and in the judgment you make of things: for as I have not that capacity that you fancy I have, so if I had it, the public would not be one jot the better when I had sacrificed my quiet to it. For most princes apply themselves more to affairs of war than to the useful arts of peace; and in these I neither have any knowledge, nor do I much desire it; they are generally more set on acquiring new kingdoms, right or wrong, than on governing well those they possess: and, among the ministers of princes, there are none that are not so wise as to need no assistance, or at least, that do not think themselves so wise that they imagine they need none; and if they court any, it is only those for whom the prince has much personal favour, whom by their fawning and flatteries they endeavour to fix to their own interests; and, indeed, nature has so made us, that we all love to be flattered and to please ourselves with our own notions: the old crow loves his young, and the ape her cubs. Now if in such a court, made up of persons who envy all others and only admire themselves, a person should but propose anything that he had either read in history or observed in his travels, the rest would think that the reputation of their wisdom would sink, and that their interests would be much depressed if they could not run it down: and, if all other things failed, then they would fly to this, that such or such things pleased our ancestors, and it were well for us if we could but match them. They would set up their rest on such an answer, as a sufficient confutation of all that could be said, as if it were a great misfortune that any should be found wiser than his ancestors. But though they willingly let go all the good things that were among those of former ages, yet, if better things are proposed, they cover themselves obstinately with this excuse of reverence to past times. I have met with these proud, morose, and absurd judgments of things in many places, particularly once in England.” “Were you ever there?” said I. “Yes, I was,” answered he, “and stayed some months there, not long after the rebellion in the West was suppressed, with a great slaughter of the poor people that were engaged in it.

“I was then much obliged to that reverend prelate, John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal, and Chancellor of England; a man,” said he, “Peter (for Mr. More knows well what he was), that was not less venerable for his wisdom and virtues than for the high character he bore: he was of a middle stature, not broken with age; his looks begot reverence rather than fear; his conversation was easy, but serious and grave; he sometimes took pleasure to try the force of those that came as suitors to him upon business by speaking sharply, though decently, to them, and by that he discovered their spirit and presence of mind; with which he was much delighted when it did not grow up to impudence, as bearing a great resemblance to his own temper, and he looked on such persons as the fittest men for affairs. He spoke both gracefully and weightily; he was eminently skilled in the law, had a vast understanding, and a prodigious memory; and those excellent talents with which nature had furnished him were improved by study and experience. When I was in England the King depended much on his counsels, and the Government seemed to be chiefly supported by him; for from his youth he had been all along practised in affairs; and, having passed through many traverses of fortune, he had, with great cost, acquired a vast stock of wisdom, which is not soon lost when it is purchased so dear. One day, when I was dining with him, there happened to be at table one of the English lawyers, who took occasion to run out in a high commendation of the severe execution of justice upon thieves, ‘who,’ as he said, ‘were then hanged so fast that there were sometimes twenty on one gibbet!’ and, upon that, he said, ‘he could not wonder enough how it came to pass that, since so few escaped, there were yet so many thieves left, who were still robbing in all places.’ Upon this, I (who took the boldness to speak freely before the Cardinal) said, ‘There was no reason to wonder at the matter, since this way of punishing thieves was neither just in itself nor good for the public; for, as the severity was too great, so the remedy was not effectual; simple theft not being so great a crime that it ought to cost a man his life; no punishment, how severe soever, being able to restrain those from robbing who can find out no other way of livelihood. In this,’ said I, ‘not only you in England, but a great part of the world, imitate some ill masters, that are readier to chastise their scholars than to teach them. There are dreadful punishments enacted against thieves, but it were much better to make such good provisions by which every man might be put in a method how to live, and so be preserved from the fatal necessity of stealing and of dying for it.’ ‘There has been care enough taken for that,’ said he; ‘there are many handicrafts, and there is husbandry, by which they may make a shift to live, unless they have a greater mind to follow ill courses.’ ‘That will not serve your turn,’ said I, ‘for many lose their limbs in civil or foreign wars, as lately in the Cornish rebellion, and some time ago in your wars with France, who, being thus mutilated in the service of their king and country, can no more follow their old trades, and are too old to learn new ones; but since wars are only accidental things, and have intervals, let us consider those things that fall out every day. There is a great number of noblemen among you that are themselves as idle as drones, that subsist on other men’s labour, on the labour of their tenants, whom, to raise their revenues, they pare to the quick. This, indeed, is the only instance of their frugality, for in all other things they are prodigal, even to the beggaring of themselves; but, besides this, they carry about with them a great number of idle fellows, who never learned any art by which they may gain their living; and these, as soon as either their lord dies, or they themselves fall sick, are turned out of doors; for your lords are readier to feed idle people than to take care of the sick; and often the heir is not able to keep together so great a family as his predecessor did. Now, when the stomachs of those that are thus turned out of doors grow keen, they rob no less keenly; and what else can they do? For when, by wandering about, they have worn out both their health and their clothes, and are tattered, and look ghastly, men of quality will not entertain them, and poor men dare not do it, knowing that one who has been bred up in idleness and pleasure, and who was used to walk about with his sword and buckler, despising all the neighbourhood with an insolent scorn as far below him, is not fit for the spade and mattock; nor will he serve a poor man for so small a hire and in so low a diet as he can afford to give him.’ To this he answered, ‘This sort of men ought to be particularly cherished, for in them consists the force of the armies for which we have occasion; since their birth inspires them with a nobler sense of honour than is to be found among tradesmen or ploughmen.’ ‘You may as well say,’ replied I, ‘that you must cherish thieves on the account of wars, for you will never want the one as long as you have the other; and as robbers prove sometimes gallant soldiers, so soldiers often prove brave robbers, so near an alliance there is between those two sorts of life. But this bad custom, so common among you, of keeping many servants, is not peculiar to this nation. In France there is yet a more pestiferous sort of people, for the whole country is full of soldiers, still kept up in time of peace (if such a state of a nation can be called a peace); and these are kept in pay upon the same account that you plead for those idle retainers about noblemen: this being a maxim of those pretended statesmen, that it is necessary for the public safety to have a good body of veteran soldiers ever in readiness. They think raw men are not to be depended on, and they sometimes seek occasions for making war, that they may train up their soldiers in the art of cutting throats, or, as Sallust observed, “for keeping their hands in use, that they may not grow dull by too long an intermission.” But France has learned to its cost how dangerous it is to feed such beasts. The fate of the Romans, Carthaginians, and Syrians, and many other nations and cities, which were both overturned and quite ruined by those standing armies, should make others wiser; and the folly of this maxim of the French appears plainly even from this, that their trained soldiers often find your raw men prove too hard for them, of which I will not say much, lest you may think I flatter the English. Every day’s experience shows that the mechanics in the towns or the clowns in the country are not afraid of fighting with those idle gentlemen, if they are not disabled by some misfortune in their body or dispirited by extreme want; so that you need not fear that those well-shaped and strong men (for it is only such that noblemen love to keep about them till they spoil them), who now grow feeble with ease and are softened with their effeminate manner of life, would be less fit for action if they were well bred and well employed. And it seems very unreasonable that, for the prospect of a war, which you need never have but when you please, you should maintain so many idle men, as will always disturb you in time of peace, which is ever to be more considered than war. But I do not think that this necessity of stealing arises only from hence; there is another cause of it, more peculiar to England.’ ‘What is that?’ said the Cardinal: ‘The increase of pasture,’ said I, ‘by which your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order, may be said now to devour men and unpeople, not only villages, but towns; for wherever it is found that the sheep of any soil yield a softer and richer wool than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men, the dobots! not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded, nor thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no good to the public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good. They stop the course of agriculture, destroying houses and towns, reserving only the churches, and enclose grounds that they may lodge their sheep in them. As if forests and parks had swallowed up too little of the land, those worthy countrymen turn the best inhabited places into solitudes; for when an insatiable wretch, who is a plague to his country, resolves to enclose many thousand acres of ground, the owners, as well as tenants, are turned out of their possessions by trick or by main force, or, being wearied out by ill usage, they are forced to sell them; by which means those miserable people, both men and women, married and unmarried, old and young, with their poor but numerous families (since country business requires many hands), are all forced to change their seats, not knowing whither to go; and they must sell, almost for nothing, their household stuff, which could not bring them much money, even though they might stay for a buyer. When that little money is at an end (for it will be soon spent), what is left for them to do but either to steal, and so to be hanged (God knows how justly!), or to go about and beg? and if they do this they are put in prison as idle vagabonds, while they would willingly work but can find none that will hire them; for there is no more occasion for country labour, to which they have been bred, when there is no arable ground left. One shepherd can look after a flock, which will stock an extent of ground that would require many hands if it were to be ploughed and reaped. This, likewise, in many places raises the price of corn. The price of wool is also so risen that the poor people, who were won't to make cloth, are no more able to buy it; and this, likewise, makes many of them idle: for since the increase of pasture God has punished the avarice of the owners by a rot among the sheep, which has destroyed vast numbers of them—to us it might have seemed more just had it fell on the owners themselves. But, suppose the sheep should increase ever so much, their price is not likely to fall; since, though they cannot be called a monopoly, because they are not engrossed by one person, yet they are in so few hands, and these are so rich, that, as they are not pressed to sell them sooner than they have a mind to it, so they never do it till they have raised the price as high as possible. And on the same account it is that the other kinds of cattle are so dear, because many villages being pulled down, and all country labour being much neglected, there are none who make it their business to breed them. The rich do not breed cattle as they do sheep, but buy them lean and at low prices; and, after they have fattened them on their grounds, sell them again at high rates. And I do not think that all the inconveniences this will produce are yet observed; for, as they sell the cattle dear, so, if they are consumed faster than the breeding countries from which they are brought can afford them, then the stock must decrease, and this must needs end in great scarcity; and by these means, this your island, which seemed as to this particular the happiest in the world, will suffer much by the cursed avarice of a few persons: besides this, the rising of corn makes all people lessen their families as much as they can; and what can those who are dismissed by them do but either beg or rob? And to this last a man of a great mind is much sooner drawn than to the former. Luxury likewise breaks in apace upon you to set forward your poverty and misery; there is an excessive vanity in apparel, and great cost in diet, and that not only in noblemen’s families, but even among tradesmen, among the farmers themselves, and among all ranks of persons. You have also many infamous houses, and, besides those that are known, the taverns and ale-houses are no better; add to these dice, cards, tables, football, tennis, and quoits, in which money runs fast away; and those that are initiated into them must, in the conclusion, betake themselves to robbing for a supply. Banish these plagues, and give orders that those who have dispeopled so much soil may either rebuild the villages they have pulled down or let out their grounds to such as will do it; restrain those engrossings of the rich, that are as bad almost as monopolies; leave fewer occasions to idleness; let agriculture be set up again, and the manufacture of the wool be regulated, that so there may be work found for those companies of idle people whom want forces to be thieves, or who now, being idle vagabonds or useless servants, will certainly grow thieves at last. If you do not find a remedy to these evils it is a vain thing to boast of your severity in punishing theft, which, though it may have the appearance of justice, yet in itself is neither just nor convenient; for if you suffer your people to be ill-educated, and their manners to be corrupted from their infancy, and then punish them for those crimes to which their first education disposed them, what else is to be concluded from this but that you first make thieves and then punish them?’

“While I was talking thus, the Counsellor, who was present, had prepared an answer, and had resolved to resume all I had said, according to the formality of a debate, in which things are generally repeated more faithfully than they are answered, as if the chief trial to be made were of men’s memories. ‘You have talked prettily, for a stranger,’ said he, ‘having heard of many things among us which you have not been able to consider well; but I will make the whole matter plain to you, and will first repeat in order all that you have said; then I will show how much your ignorance of our affairs has misled you; and will, in the last place, answer all your arguments. And, that I may begin where I promised, there were four things—’ ‘Hold your peace!’ said the Cardinal; ‘this will take up too much time; therefore we will, at present, ease you of the trouble of answering, and reserve it to our next meeting, which shall be to-morrow, if Raphael’s affairs and yours can admit of it. But, Raphael,’ said he to me, ‘I would gladly know upon what reason it is that you think theft ought not to be punished by death: would you give way to it? or do you propose any other punishment that will be more useful to the public? for, since death does not restrain theft, if men thought their lives would be safe, what fear or force could restrain ill men? On the contrary, they would look on the mitigation of the punishment as an invitation to commit more crimes.’ I answered, ‘It seems to me a very unjust thing to take away a man’s life for a little money, for nothing in the world can be of equal value with a man’s life: and if it be said, “that it is not for the money that one suffers, but for his breaking the law,” I must say, extreme justice is an extreme injury: for we ought not to approve of those terrible laws that make the smallest offences capital, nor of that opinion of the Stoics that makes all crimes equal; as if there were no difference to be made between the killing a man and the taking his purse, between which, if we examine things impartially, there is no likeness nor proportion. God has commanded us not to kill, and shall we kill so easily for a little money? But if one shall say, that by that law we are only forbid to kill any except when the laws of the land allow of it, upon the same grounds, laws may be made, in some cases, to allow of adultery and perjury: for God having taken from us the right of disposing either of our own or of other people’s lives, if it is pretended that the mutual consent of men in making laws can authorise man-slaughter in cases in which God has given us no example, that it frees people from the obligation of the divine law, and so makes murder a lawful action, what is this, but to give a preference to human laws before the divine? and, if this is once admitted, by the same rule men may, in all other things, put what restrictions they please upon the laws of God. If, by the Mosaical law, though it was rough and severe, as being a yoke laid on an obstinate and servile nation, men were only fined, and not put to death for theft, we cannot imagine, that in this new law of mercy, in which God treats us with the tenderness of a father, He has given us a greater licence to cruelty than He did to the Jews. Upon these reasons it is, that I think putting thieves to death is not lawful; and it is plain and obvious that it is absurd and of ill consequence to the commonwealth that a thief and a murderer should be equally punished; for if a robber sees that his danger is the same if he is convicted of theft as if he were guilty of murder, this will naturally incite him to kill the person whom otherwise he would only have robbed; since, if the punishment is the same, there is more security, and less danger of discovery, when he that can best make it is put out of the way; so that terrifying thieves too much provokes them to cruelty.

“But as to the question, ‘What more convenient way of punishment can be found?’ I think it much easier to find out that than to invent anything that is worse; why should we doubt but the way that was so long in use among the old Romans, who understood so well the arts of government, was very proper for their punishment? They condemned such as they found guilty of great crimes to work their whole lives in quarries, or to dig in mines with chains about them. But the method that I liked best was that which I observed in my travels in Persia, among the Polylerits, who are a considerable and well-governed people: they pay a yearly tribute to the King of Persia, but in all other respects they are a free nation, and governed by their own laws: they lie far from the sea, and are environed with hills; and, being contented with the productions of their own country, which is very fruitful, they have little commerce with any other nation; and as they, according to the genius of their country, have no inclination to enlarge their borders, so their mountains and the pension they pay to the Persian, secure them from all invasions. Thus they have no wars among them; they live rather conveniently than with splendour, and may be rather called a happy nation than either eminent or famous; for I do not think that they are known, so much as by name, to any but their next neighbours. Those that are found guilty of theft among them are bound to make restitution to the owner, and not, as it is in other places, to the prince, for they reckon that the prince has no more right to the stolen goods than the thief; but if that which was stolen is no more in being, then the goods of the thieves are estimated, and restitution being made out of them, the remainder is given to their wives and children; and they themselves are condemned to serve in the public works, but are neither imprisoned nor chained, unless there happens to be some extraordinary circumstance in their crimes. They go about loose and free, working for the public: if they are idle or backward to work they are whipped, but if they work hard they are well used and treated without any mark of reproach; only the lists of them are called always at night, and then they are shut up. They suffer no other uneasiness but this of constant labour; for, as they work for the public, so they are well entertained out of the public stock, which is done differently in different places: in some places whatever is bestowed on them is raised by a charitable contribution; and, though this way may seem uncertain, yet so merciful are the inclinations of that people, that they are plentifully supplied by it; but in other places public revenues are set aside for them, or there is a constant tax or poll-money raised for their maintenance. In some places they are set to no public work, but every private man that has occasion to hire workmen goes to the market-places and hires them of the public, a little lower than he would do a freeman. If they go lazily about their task he may quicken them with the whip. By this means there is always some piece of work or other to be done by them; and, besides their livelihood, they earn somewhat still to the public. They all wear a peculiar habit, of one certain colour, and their hair is cropped a little above their ears, and a piece of one of their ears is cut off. Their friends are allowed to give them either meat, drink, or clothes, so they are of their proper colour; but it is death, both to the giver and taker, if they give them money; nor is it less penal for any freeman to take money from them upon any account whatsoever: and it is also death for any of these slaves (so they are called) to handle arms. Those of every division of the country are distinguished by a peculiar mark, which it is capital for them to lay aside, to go out of their bounds, or to talk with a slave of another jurisdiction, and the very attempt of an escape is no less penal than an escape itself. It is death for any other slave to be accessory to it; and if a freeman engages in it he is condemned to slavery. Those that discover it are rewarded—if freemen, in money; and if slaves, with liberty, together with a pardon for being accessory to it; that so they might find their account rather in repenting of their engaging in such a design than in persisting in it.

“These are their laws and rules in relation to robbery, and it is obvious that they are as advantageous as they are mild and gentle; since vice is not only destroyed and men preserved, but they are treated in such a manner as to make them see the necessity of being honest and of employing the rest of their lives in repairing the injuries they had formerly done to society. Nor is there any hazard of their falling back to their old customs; and so little do travellers apprehend mischief from them that they generally make use of them for guides from one jurisdiction to another; for there is nothing left them by which they can rob or be the better for it, since, as they are disarmed, so the very having of money is a sufficient conviction: and as they are certainly punished if discovered, so they cannot hope to escape; for their habit being in all the parts of it different from what is commonly worn, they cannot fly away, unless they would go naked, and even then their cropped ear would betray them. The only danger to be feared from them is their conspiring against the government; but those of one division and neighbourhood can do nothing to any purpose unless a general conspiracy were laid amongst all the slaves of the several jurisdictions, which cannot be done, since they cannot meet or talk together; nor will any venture on a design where the concealment would be so dangerous and the discovery so profitable. None are quite hopeless of recovering their freedom, since by their obedience and patience, and by giving good grounds to believe that they will change their manner of life for the future, they may expect at last to obtain their liberty, and some are every year restored to it upon the good character that is given of them. When I had related all this, I added that I did not see why such a method might not be followed with more advantage than could ever be expected from that severe justice which the Counsellor magnified so much. To this he answered, ‘That it could never take place in England without endangering the whole nation.’ As he said this he shook his head, made some grimaces, and held his peace, while all the company seemed of his opinion, except the Cardinal, who said, ‘That it was not easy to form a judgment of its success, since it was a method that never yet had been tried; but if,’ said he, ‘when sentence of death were passed upon a thief, the prince would reprieve him for a while, and make the experiment upon him, denying him the privilege of a sanctuary; and then, if it had a good effect upon him, it might take place; and, if it did not succeed, the worst would be to execute the sentence on the condemned persons at last; and I do not see,’ added he, ‘why it would be either unjust, inconvenient, or at all dangerous to admit of such a delay; in my opinion the vagabonds ought to be treated in the same manner, against whom, though we have made many laws, yet we have not been able to gain our end.’ When the Cardinal had done, they all commended the motion, though they had despised it when it came from me, but more particularly commended what related to the vagabonds, because it was his own observation.

“I do not know whether it be worth while to tell what followed, for it was very ridiculous; but I shall venture at it, for as it is not foreign to this matter, so some good use may be made of it. There was a Jester standing by, that counterfeited the fool so naturally that he seemed to be really one; the jests which he offered were so cold and dull that we laughed more at him than at them, yet sometimes he said, as it were by chance, things that were not unpleasant, so as to justify the old proverb, ‘That he who throws the dice often, will sometimes have a lucky hit.’ When one of the company had said that I had taken care of the thieves, and the Cardinal had taken care of the vagabonds, so that there remained nothing but that some public provision might be made for the poor whom sickness or old age had disabled from labour, ‘Leave that to me,’ said the Fool, ‘and I shall take care of them, for there is no sort of people whose sight I abhor more, having been so often vexed with them and with their sad complaints; but as dolefully soever as they have told their tale, they could never prevail so far as to draw one penny from me; for either I had no mind to give them anything, or, when I had a mind to do it, I had nothing to give them; and they now know me so well that they will not lose their labour, but let me pass without giving me any trouble, because they hope for nothing—no more, in faith, than if I were a priest; but I would have a law made for sending all these beggars to monasteries, the men to the Benedictines, to be made lay-brothers, and the women to be nuns.’ The Cardinal smiled, and approved of it in jest, but the rest liked it in earnest. There was a divine present, who, though he was a grave morose man, yet he was so pleased with this reflection that was made on the priests and the monks that he began to play with the Fool, and said to him, ‘This will not deliver you from all beggars, except you take care of us Friars.’ ‘That is done already,’ answered the Fool, ‘for the Cardinal has provided for you by what he proposed for restraining vagabonds and setting them to work, for I know no vagabonds like you.’ This was well entertained by the whole company, who, looking at the Cardinal, perceived that he was not ill-pleased at it; only the Friar himself was vexed, as may be easily imagined, and fell into such a passion that he could not forbear railing at the Fool, and calling him knave, slanderer, backbiter, and son of perdition, and then cited some dreadful threatenings out of the Scriptures against him. Now the Jester thought he was in his element, and laid about him freely. ‘Good Friar,’ said he, ‘be not angry, for it is written, “In patience possess your soul.”’ The Friar answered (for I shall give you his own words), ‘I am not angry, you hangman; at least, I do not sin in it, for the Psalmist says, “Be ye angry and sin not.”’ Upon this the Cardinal admonished him gently, and wished him to govern his passions. ‘No, my lord,’ said he, ‘I speak not but from a good zeal, which I ought to have, for holy men have had a good zeal, as it is said, “The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up;” and we sing in our church that those who mocked Elisha as he went up to the house of God felt the effects of his zeal, which that mocker, that rogue, that scoundrel, will perhaps feel.’ ‘You do this, perhaps, with a good intention,’ said the Cardinal, ‘but, in my opinion, it were wiser in you, and perhaps better for you, not to engage in so ridiculous a contest with a Fool.’ ‘No, my lord,’ answered he, ‘that were not wisely done, for Solomon, the wisest of men, said, “Answer a Fool according to his folly,” which I now do, and show him the ditch into which he will fall, if he is not aware of it; for if the many mockers of Elisha, who was but one bald man, felt the effect of his zeal, what will become of the mocker of so many Friars, among whom there are so many bald men? We have, likewise, a bull, by which all that jeer us are excommunicated.’ When the Cardinal saw that there was no end of this matter he made a sign to the Fool to withdraw, turned the discourse another way, and soon after rose from the table, and, dismissing us, went to hear causes.

“Thus, Mr. More, I have run out into a tedious story, of the length of which I had been ashamed, if (as you earnestly begged it of me) I had not observed you to hearken to it as if you had no mind to lose any part of it. I might have contracted it, but I resolved to give it you at large, that you might observe how those that despised what I had proposed, no sooner perceived that the Cardinal did not dislike it but presently approved of it, fawned so on him and flattered him to such a degree, that they in good earnest applauded those things that he only liked in jest; and from hence you may gather how little courtiers would value either me or my counsels.”

To this I answered, “You have done me a great kindness in this relation; for as everything has been related by you both wisely and pleasantly, so you have made me imagine that I was in my own country and grown young again, by recalling that good Cardinal to my thoughts, in whose family I was bred from my childhood; and though you are, upon other accounts, very dear to me, yet you are the dearer because you honour his memory so much; but, after all this, I cannot change my opinion, for I still think that if you could overcome that aversion which you have to the courts of princes, you might, by the advice which it is in your power to give, do a great deal of good to mankind, and this is the chief design that every good man ought to propose to himself in living; for your friend Plato thinks that nations will be happy when either philosophers become kings or kings become philosophers. It is no wonder if we are so far from that happiness while philosophers will not think it their duty to assist kings with their counsels.” “They are not so base-minded,” said he, “but that they would willingly do it; many of them have already done it by their books, if those that are in power would but hearken to their good advice. But Plato judged right, that except kings themselves became philosophers, they who from their childhood are corrupted with false notions would never fall in entirely with the counsels of philosophers, and this he himself found to be true in the person of Dionysius.

“Do not you think that if I were about any king, proposing good laws to him, and endeavouring to root out all the cursed seeds of evil that I found in him, I should either be turned out of his court, or, at least, be laughed at for my pains? For instance, what could I signify if I were about the King of France, and were called into his cabinet council, where several wise men, in his hearing, were proposing many expedients; as, by what arts and practices Milan may be kept, and Naples, that has so often slipped out of their hands, recovered; how the Venetians, and after them the rest of Italy, may be subdued; and then how Flanders, Brabant, and all Burgundy, and some other kingdoms which he has swallowed already in his designs, may be added to his empire? One proposes a league with the Venetians, to be kept as long as he finds his account in it, and that he ought to communicate counsels with them, and give them some share of the spoil till his success makes him need or fear them less, and then it will be easily taken out of their hands; another proposes the hiring the Germans and the securing the Switzers by pensions; another proposes the gaining the Emperor by money, which is omnipotent with him; another proposes a peace with the King of Arragon, and, in order to cement it, the yielding up the King of Navarre’s pretensions; another thinks that the Prince of Castile is to be wrought on by the hope of an alliance, and that some of his courtiers are to be gained to the French faction by pensions. The hardest point of all is, what to do with England; a treaty of peace is to be set on foot, and, if their alliance is not to be depended on, yet it is to be made as firm as possible, and they are to be called friends, but suspected as enemies: therefore the Scots are to be kept in readiness to be let loose upon England on every occasion; and some banished nobleman is to be supported underhand (for by the League it cannot be done avowedly) who has a pretension to the crown, by which means that suspected prince may be kept in awe. Now when things are in so great a fermentation, and so many gallant men are joining counsels how to carry on the war, if so mean a man as I should stand up and wish them to change all their counsels—to let Italy alone and stay at home, since the kingdom of France was indeed greater than could be well governed by one man; that therefore he ought not to think of adding others to it; and if, after this, I should propose to them the resolutions of the Achorians, a people that lie on the south-east of Utopia, who long ago engaged in war in order to add to the dominions of their prince another kingdom, to which he had some pretensions by an ancient alliance: this they conquered, but found that the trouble of keeping it was equal to that by which it was gained; that the conquered people were always either in rebellion or exposed to foreign invasions, while they were obliged to be incessantly at war, either for or against them, and consequently could never disband their army; that in the meantime they were oppressed with taxes, their money went out of the kingdom, their blood was spilt for the glory of their king without procuring the least advantage to the people, who received not the smallest benefit from it even in time of peace; and that, their manners being corrupted by a long war, robbery and murders everywhere abounded, and their laws fell into contempt; while their king, distracted with the care of two kingdoms, was the less able to apply his mind to the interest of either. When they saw this, and that there would be no end to these evils, they by joint counsels made an humble address to their king, desiring him to choose which of the two kingdoms he had the greatest mind to keep, since he could not hold both; for they were too great a people to be governed by a divided king, since no man would willingly have a groom that should be in common between him and another. Upon which the good prince was forced to quit his new kingdom to one of his friends (who was not long after dethroned), and to be contented with his old one. To this I would add that after all those warlike attempts, the vast confusions, and the consumption both of treasure and of people that must follow them, perhaps upon some misfortune they might be forced to throw up all at last; therefore it seemed much more eligible that the king should improve his ancient kingdom all he could, and make it flourish as much as possible; that he should love his people, and be beloved of them; that he should live among them, govern them gently and let other kingdoms alone, since that which had fallen to his share was big enough, if not too big, for him:—pray, how do you think would such a speech as this be heard?”

“I confess,” said I, “I think not very well.”

“But what,” said he, “if I should sort with another kind of ministers, whose chief contrivances and consultations were by what art the prince’s treasures might be increased? where one proposes raising the value of specie when the king’s debts are large, and lowering it when his revenues were to come in, that so he might both pay much with a little, and in a little receive a great deal. Another proposes a pretence of a war, that money might be raised in order to carry it on, and that a peace be concluded as soon as that was done; and this with such appearances of religion as might work on the people, and make them impute it to the piety of their prince, and to his tenderness for the lives of his subjects. A third offers some old musty laws that have been antiquated by a long disuse (and which, as they had been forgotten by all the subjects, so they had also been broken by them), and proposes the levying the penalties of these laws, that, as it would bring in a vast treasure, so there might be a very good pretence for it, since it would look like the executing a law and the doing of justice. A fourth proposes the prohibiting of many things under severe penalties, especially such as were against the interest of the people, and then the dispensing with these prohibitions, upon great compositions, to those who might find their advantage in breaking them. This would serve two ends, both of them acceptable to many; for as those whose avarice led them to transgress would be severely fined, so the selling licences dear would look as if a prince were tender of his people, and would not easily, or at low rates, dispense with anything that might be against the public good. Another proposes that the judges must be made sure, that they may declare always in favour of the prerogative; that they must be often sent for to court, that the king may hear them argue those points in which he is concerned; since, how unjust soever any of his pretensions may be, yet still some one or other of them, either out of contradiction to others, or the pride of singularity, or to make their court, would find out some pretence or other to give the king a fair colour to carry the point. For if the judges but differ in opinion, the clearest thing in the world is made by that means disputable, and truth being once brought in question, the king may then take advantage to expound the law for his own profit; while the judges that stand out will be brought over, either through fear or modesty; and they being thus gained, all of them may be sent to the Bench to give sentence boldly as the king would have it; for fair pretences will never be wanting when sentence is to be given in the prince’s favour. It will either be said that equity lies of his side, or some words in the law will be found sounding that way, or some forced sense will be put on them; and, when all other things fail, the king’s undoubted prerogative will be pretended, as that which is above all law, and to which a religious judge ought to have a special regard. Thus all consent to that maxim of Crassus, that a prince cannot have treasure enough, since he must maintain his armies out of it; that a king, even though he would, can do nothing unjustly; that all property is in him, not excepting the very persons of his subjects; and that no man has any other property but that which the king, out of his goodness, thinks fit to leave him. And they think it is the prince’s interest that there be as little of this left as may be, as if it were his advantage that his people should have neither riches nor liberty, since these things make them less easy and willing to submit to a cruel and unjust government. Whereas necessity and poverty blunts them, makes them patient, beats them down, and breaks that height of spirit that might otherwise dispose them to rebel. Now what if, after all these propositions were made, I should rise up and assert that such counsels were both unbecoming a king and mischievous to him; and that not only his honour, but his safety, consisted more in his people’s wealth than in his own; if I should show that they choose a king for their own sake, and not for his; that, by his care and endeavours, they may be both easy and safe; and that, therefore, a prince ought to take more care of his people’s happiness than of his own, as a shepherd is to take more care of his flock than of himself? It is also certain that they are much mistaken that think the poverty of a nation is a mean of the public safety. Who quarrel more than beggars? who does more earnestly long for a change than he that is uneasy in his present circumstances? and who run to create confusions with so desperate a boldness as those who, having nothing to lose, hope to gain by them? If a king should fall under such contempt or envy that he could not keep his subjects in their duty but by oppression and ill usage, and by rendering them poor and miserable, it were certainly better for him to quit his kingdom than to retain it by such methods as make him, while he keeps the name of authority, lose the majesty due to it. Nor is it so becoming the dignity of a king to reign over beggars as over rich and happy subjects. And therefore Fabricius, a man of a noble and exalted temper, said ‘he would rather govern rich men than be rich himself; since for one man to abound in wealth and pleasure when all about him are mourning and groaning, is to be a gaoler and not a king.’ He is an unskilful physician that cannot cure one disease without casting his patient into another. So he that can find no other way for correcting the errors of his people but by taking from them the conveniences of life, shows that he knows not what it is to govern a free nation. He himself ought rather to shake off his sloth, or to lay down his pride, for the contempt or hatred that his people have for him takes its rise from the vices in himself. Let him live upon what belongs to him without wronging others, and accommodate his expense to his revenue. Let him punish crimes, and, by his wise conduct, let him endeavour to prevent them, rather than be severe when he has suffered them to be too common. Let him not rashly revive laws that are abrogated by disuse, especially if they have been long forgotten and never wanted. And let him never take any penalty for the breach of them to which a judge would not give way in a private man, but would look on him as a crafty and unjust person for pretending to it. To these things I would add that law among the Macarians—a people that live not far from Utopia—by which their king, on the day on which he began to reign, is tied by an oath, confirmed by solemn sacrifices, never to have at once above a thousand pounds of gold in his treasures, or so much silver as is equal to that in value. This law, they tell us, was made by an excellent king who had more regard to the riches of his country than to his own wealth, and therefore provided against the heaping up of so much treasure as might impoverish the people. He thought that moderate sum might be sufficient for any accident, if either the king had occasion for it against the rebels, or the kingdom against the invasion of an enemy; but that it was not enough to encourage a prince to invade other men’s rights—a circumstance that was the chief cause of his making that law. He also thought that it was a good provision for that free circulation of money so necessary for the course of commerce and exchange. And when a king must distribute all those extraordinary accessions that increase treasure beyond the due pitch, it makes him less disposed to oppress his subjects. Such a king as this will be the terror of ill men, and will be beloved by all the good.

“If, I say, I should talk of these or such-like things to men that had taken their bias another way, how deaf would they be to all I could say!” “No doubt, very deaf,” answered I; “and no wonder, for one is never to offer propositions or advice that we are certain will not be entertained. Discourses so much out of the road could not avail anything, nor have any effect on men whose minds were prepossessed with different sentiments. This philosophical way of speculation is not unpleasant among friends in a free conversation; but there is no room for it in the courts of princes, where great affairs are carried on by authority.” “That is what I was saying,” replied he, “that there is no room for philosophy in the courts of princes.” “Yes, there is,” said I, “but not for this speculative philosophy, that makes everything to be alike fitting at all times; but there is another philosophy that is more pliable, that knows its proper scene, accommodates itself to it, and teaches a man with propriety and decency to act that part which has fallen to his share. If when one of Plautus’ comedies is upon the stage, and a company of servants are acting their parts, you should come out in the garb of a philosopher, and repeat, out of Octavia, a discourse of Seneca’s to Nero, would it not be better for you to say nothing than by mixing things of such different natures to make an impertinent tragi-comedy? for you spoil and corrupt the play that is in hand when you mix with it things of an opposite nature, even though they are much better. Therefore go through with the play that is acting the best you can, and do not confound it because another that is pleasanter comes into your thoughts. It is even so in a commonwealth and in the councils of princes; if ill opinions cannot be quite rooted out, and you cannot cure some received vice according to your wishes, you must not, therefore, abandon the commonwealth, for the same reasons as you should not forsake the ship in a storm because you cannot command the winds. You are not obliged to assault people with discourses that are out of their road, when you see that their received notions must prevent your making an impression upon them: you ought rather to cast about and to manage things with all the dexterity in your power, so that, if you are not able to make them go well, they may be as little ill as possible; for, except all men were good, everything cannot be right, and that is a blessing that I do not at present hope to see.” “According to your argument,” answered he, “all that I could be able to do would be to preserve myself from being mad while I endeavoured to cure the madness of others; for, if I speak with, I must repeat what I have said to you; and as for lying, whether a philosopher can do it or not I cannot tell: I am sure I cannot do it. But though these discourses may be uneasy and ungrateful to them, I do not see why they should seem foolish or extravagant; indeed, if I should either propose such things as Plato has contrived in his ‘Commonwealth,’ or as the Utopians practise in theirs, though they might seem better, as certainly they are, yet they are so different from our establishment, which is founded on property (there being no such thing among them), that I could not expect that it would have any effect on them. But such discourses as mine, which only call past evils to mind and give warning of what may follow, leave nothing in them that is so absurd that they may not be used at any time, for they can only be unpleasant to those who are resolved to run headlong the contrary way; and if we must let alone everything as absurd or extravagant—which, by reason of the wicked lives of many, may seem uncouth—we must, even among Christians, give over pressing the greatest part of those things that Christ hath taught us, though He has commanded us not to conceal them, but to proclaim on the housetops that which He taught in secret. The greatest parts of His precepts are more opposite to the lives of the men of this age than any part of my discourse has been, but the preachers seem to have learned that craft to which you advise me: for they, observing that the world would not willingly suit their lives to the rules that Christ has given, have fitted His doctrine, as if it had been a leaden rule, to their lives, that so, some way or other, they might agree with one another. But I see no other effect of this compliance except it be that men become more secure in their wickedness by it; and this is all the success that I can have in a court, for I must always differ from the rest, and then I shall signify nothing; or, if I agree with them, I shall then only help forward their madness. I do not comprehend what you mean by your ‘casting about,’ or by ‘the bending and handling things so dexterously that, if they go not well, they may go as little ill as may be;’ for in courts they will not bear with a man’s holding his peace or conniving at what others do: a man must barefacedly approve of the worst counsels and consent to the blackest designs, so that he would pass for a spy, or, possibly, for a traitor, that did but coldly approve of such wicked practices; and therefore when a man is engaged in such a society, he will be so far from being able to mend matters by his ‘casting about,’ as you call it, that he will find no occasions of doing any good—the ill company will sooner corrupt him than be the better for him; or if, notwithstanding all their ill company, he still remains steady and innocent, yet their follies and knavery will be imputed to him; and, by mixing counsels with them, he must bear his share of all the blame that belongs wholly to others.

“It was no ill simile by which Plato set forth the unreasonableness of a philosopher’s meddling with government. ‘If a man,’ says he, ‘were to see a great company run out every day into the rain and take delight in being wet—if he knew that it would be to no purpose for him to go and persuade them to return to their houses in order to avoid the storm, and that all that could be expected by his going to speak to them would be that he himself should be as wet as they, it would be best for him to keep within doors, and, since he had not influence enough to correct other people’s folly, to take care to preserve himself.’

“Though, to speak plainly my real sentiments, I must freely own that as long as there is any property, and while money is the standard of all other things, I cannot think that a nation can be governed either justly or happily: not justly, because the best things will fall to the share of the worst men; nor happily, because all things will be divided among a few (and even these are not in all respects happy), the rest being left to be absolutely miserable. Therefore, when I reflect on the wise and good constitution of the Utopians, among whom all things are so well governed and with so few laws, where virtue hath its due reward, and yet there is such an equality that every man lives in plenty—when I compare with them so many other nations that are still making new laws, and yet can never bring their constitution to a right regulation; where, notwithstanding every one has his property, yet all the laws that they can invent have not the power either to obtain or preserve it, or even to enable men certainly to distinguish what is their own from what is another’s, of which the many lawsuits that every day break out, and are eternally depending, give too plain a demonstration—when, I say, I balance all these things in my thoughts, I grow more favourable to Plato, and do not wonder that he resolved not to make any laws for such as would not submit to a community of all things; for so wise a man could not but foresee that the setting all upon a level was the only way to make a nation happy; which cannot be obtained so long as there is property, for when every man draws to himself all that he can compass, by one title or another, it must needs follow that, how plentiful soever a nation may be, yet a few dividing the wealth of it among themselves, the rest must fall into indigence. So that there will be two sorts of people among them, who deserve that their fortunes should be interchanged—the former useless, but wicked and ravenous; and the latter, who by their constant industry serve the public more than themselves, sincere and modest men—from whence I am persuaded that till property is taken away, there can be no equitable or just distribution of things, nor can the world be happily governed; for as long as that is maintained, the greatest and the far best part of mankind, will be still oppressed with a load of cares and anxieties. I confess, without taking it quite away, those pressures that lie on a great part of mankind may be made lighter, but they can never be quite removed; for if laws were made to determine at how great an extent in soil, and at how much money, every man must stop—to limit the prince, that he might not grow too great; and to restrain the people, that they might not become too insolent—and that none might factiously aspire to public employments, which ought neither to be sold nor made burdensome by a great expense, since otherwise those that serve in them would be tempted to reimburse themselves by cheats and violence, and it would become necessary to find out rich men for undergoing those employments, which ought rather to be trusted to the wise. These laws, I say, might have such effect as good diet and care might have on a sick man whose recovery is desperate; they might allay and mitigate the disease, but it could never be quite healed, nor the body politic be brought again to a good habit as long as property remains; and it will fall out, as in a complication of diseases, that by applying a remedy to one sore you will provoke another, and that which removes the one ill symptom produces others, while the strengthening one part of the body weakens the rest.” “On the contrary,” answered I, “it seems to me that men cannot live conveniently where all things are common. How can there be any plenty where every man will excuse himself from labour? for as the hope of gain doth not excite him, so the confidence that he has in other men’s industry may make him slothful. If people come to be pinched with want, and yet cannot dispose of anything as their own, what can follow upon this but perpetual sedition and bloodshed, especially when the reverence and authority due to magistrates falls to the ground? for I cannot imagine how that can be kept up among those that are in all things equal to one another.” “I do not wonder,” said he, “that it appears so to you, since you have no notion, or at least no right one, of such a constitution; but if you had been in Utopia with me, and had seen their laws and rules, as I did, for the space of five years, in which I lived among them, and during which time I was so delighted with them that indeed I should never have left them if it had not been to make the discovery of that new world to the Europeans, you would then confess that you had never seen a people so well constituted as they.” “You will not easily persuade me,” said Peter, “that any nation in that new world is better governed than those among us; for as our understandings are not worse than theirs, so our government (if I mistake not) being more ancient, a long practice has helped us to find out many conveniences of life, and some happy chances have discovered other things to us which no man’s understanding could ever have invented.” “As for the antiquity either of their government or of ours,” said he, “you cannot pass a true judgment of it unless you had read their histories; for, if they are to be believed, they had towns among them before these parts were so much as inhabited; and as for those discoveries that have been either hit on by chance or made by ingenious men, these might have happened there as well as here. I do not deny but we are more ingenious than they are, but they exceed us much in industry and application. They knew little concerning us before our arrival among them. They call us all by a general name of ‘The nations that lie beyond the equinoctial line;’ for their chronicle mentions a shipwreck that was made on their coast twelve hundred years ago, and that some Romans and Egyptians that were in the ship, getting safe ashore, spent the rest of their days amongst them; and such was their ingenuity that from this single opportunity they drew the advantage of learning from those unlooked-for guests, and acquired all the useful arts that were then among the Romans, and which were known to these shipwrecked men; and by the hints that they gave them they themselves found out even some of those arts which they could not fully explain, so happily did they improve that accident of having some of our people cast upon their shore. But if such an accident has at any time brought any from thence into Europe, we have been so far from improving it that we do not so much as remember it, as, in aftertimes perhaps, it will be forgot by our people that I was ever there; for though they, from one such accident, made themselves masters of all the good inventions that were among us, yet I believe it would be long before we should learn or put in practice any of the good institutions that are among them. And this is the true cause of their being better governed and living happier than we, though we come not short of them in point of understanding or outward advantages.” Upon this I said to him, “I earnestly beg you would describe that island very particularly to us; be not too short, but set out in order all things relating to their soil, their rivers, their towns, their people, their manners, constitution, laws, and, in a word, all that you imagine we desire to know; and you may well imagine that we desire to know everything concerning them of which we are hitherto ignorant.” “I will do it very willingly,” said he, “for I have digested the whole matter carefully, but it will take up some time.” “Let us go, then,” said I, “first and dine, and then we shall have leisure enough.” He consented; we went in and dined, and after dinner came back and sat down in the same place. I ordered my servants to take care that none might come and interrupt us, and both Peter and I desired Raphael to be as good as his word. When he saw that we were very intent upon it he paused a little to recollect himself, and began in this manner:—

“The island of Utopia is in the middle two hundred miles broad, and holds almost at the same breadth over a great part of it, but it grows narrower towards both ends. Its figure is not unlike a crescent. Between its horns the sea comes in eleven miles broad, and spreads itself into a great bay, which is environed with land to the compass of about five hundred miles, and is well secured from winds. In this bay there is no great current; the whole coast is, as it were, one continued harbour, which gives all that live in the island great convenience for mutual commerce. But the entry into the bay, occasioned by rocks on the one hand and shallows on the other, is very dangerous. In the middle of it there is one single rock which appears above water, and may, therefore, easily be avoided; and on the top of it there is a tower, in which a garrison is kept; the other rocks lie under water, and are very dangerous. The channel is known only to the natives; so that if any stranger should enter into the bay without one of their pilots he would run great danger of shipwreck. For even they themselves could not pass it safe if some marks that are on the coast did not direct their way; and if these should be but a little shifted, any fleet that might come against them, how great soever it were, would be certainly lost. On the other side of the island there are likewise many harbours; and the coast is so fortified, both by nature and art, that a small number of men can hinder the descent of a great army. But they report (and there remains good marks of it to make it credible) that this was no island at first, but a part of the continent. Utopus, that conquered it (whose name it still carries, for Abraxa was its first name), brought the rude and uncivilised inhabitants into such a good government, and to that measure of politeness, that they now far excel all the rest of mankind. Having soon subdued them, he designed to separate them from the continent, and to bring the sea quite round them. To accomplish this he ordered a deep channel to be dug, fifteen miles long; and that the natives might not think he treated them like slaves, he not only forced the inhabitants, but also his own soldiers, to labour in carrying it on. As he set a vast number of men to work, he, beyond all men’s expectations, brought it to a speedy conclusion. And his neighbours, who at first laughed at the folly of the undertaking, no sooner saw it brought to perfection than they were struck with admiration and terror.

“There are fifty-four cities in the island, all large and well built, the manners, customs, and laws of which are the same, and they are all contrived as near in the same manner as the ground on which they stand will allow. The nearest lie at least twenty-four miles’ distance from one another, and the most remote are not so far distant but that a man can go on foot in one day from it to that which lies next it. Every city sends three of their wisest senators once a year to Amaurot, to consult about their common concerns; for that is the chief town of the island, being situated near the centre of it, so that it is the most convenient place for their assemblies. The jurisdiction of every city extends at least twenty miles, and, where the towns lie wider, they have much more ground. No town desires to enlarge its bounds, for the people consider themselves rather as tenants than landlords. They have built, over all the country, farmhouses for husbandmen, which are well contrived, and furnished with all things necessary for country labour. Inhabitants are sent, by turns, from the cities to dwell in them; no country family has fewer than forty men and women in it, besides two slaves. There is a master and a mistress set over every family, and over thirty families there is a magistrate. Every year twenty of this family come back to the town after they have stayed two years in the country, and in their room there are other twenty sent from the town, that they may learn country work from those that have been already one year in the country, as they must teach those that come to them the next from the town. By this means such as dwell in those country farms are never ignorant of agriculture, and so commit no errors which might otherwise be fatal and bring them under a scarcity of corn. But though there is every year such a shifting of the husbandmen to prevent any man being forced against his will to follow that hard course of life too long, yet many among them take such pleasure in it that they desire leave to continue in it many years. These husbandmen till the ground, breed cattle, hew wood, and convey it to the towns either by land or water, as is most convenient. They breed an infinite multitude of chickens in a very curious manner; for the hens do not sit and hatch them, but a vast number of eggs are laid in a gentle and equal heat in order to be hatched, and they are no sooner out of the shell, and able to stir about, but they seem to consider those that feed them as their mothers, and follow them as other chickens do the hen that hatched them. They breed very few horses, but those they have are full of mettle, and are kept only for exercising their youth in the art of sitting and riding them; for they do not put them to any work, either of ploughing or carriage, in which they employ oxen. For though their horses are stronger, yet they find oxen can hold out longer; and as they are not subject to so many diseases, so they are kept upon a less charge and with less trouble. And even when they are so worn out that they are no more fit for labour, they are good meat at last. They sow no corn but that which is to be their bread; for they drink either wine, cider or perry, and often water, sometimes boiled with honey or liquorice, with which they abound; and though they know exactly how much corn will serve every town and all that tract of country which belongs to it, yet they sow much more and breed more cattle than are necessary for their consumption, and they give that overplus of which they make no use to their neighbours. When they want anything in the country which it does not produce, they fetch that from the town, without carrying anything in exchange for it. And the magistrates of the town take care to see it given them; for they meet generally in the town once a month, upon a festival day. When the time of harvest comes, the magistrates in the country send to those in the towns and let them know how many hands they will need for reaping the harvest; and the number they call for being sent to them, they commonly despatch it all in one day.

1473,Randy Travis,27,He Walked On Water,1990,"

[Intro]
He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Verse 1]
He said he was a cowboy, when he was young
He could handle a rope, and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son
And I thought, that he walked, on water

[Chorus]
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Verse 2]
Then he tied a cord, to the end of a mop
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

[Bridge]
And he was ninety years old in '63
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died
'Cause I thought, that he walked, on water

[Chorus]
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And though his wings, they were never seen
I thought, that he walked, on water

[Outro]
Yeah, I thought that he walked, on water

If you see me sit for hours and you wonder what is wrong
Well it hurts to talk about it but my world just fell apart
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

[Verse 2]
Did you see the teardrops falling and the tremble in my hands
Then you'll know that there's a story and nobody understands
It's a sad and lonely story but I'll try to make it short
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

[Chorus]
Should you wonder how I got this way, well listen, listen good
He left me for another, thought he'd be the last who would
So I'm trying to forget him, looking for a place to start
I'm a walkin', talkin', cryin', barely beatin' broken heart

You may wonder how I got this way, well listen, listen good

There you go falling in love again
This time it's for real

Give me a call
And see if I care

Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

1477,Eddy Raven,31,Island,1990,"

There was a time
There was a place I loved
That was my moment
That's just the way it was

Careless and crazy
Running to, God knows where
Now where is that heartland?
Where is the one who cares?

I can hear you calling
Wandering boy, come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon

Who am I fooling?
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again

I fight with my mem'ry
Find all the pieces I can
Of a beautiful woman
Who trusted her heart in my hands

Now what kind of sailor
Would let such a dream get lost?
Tonight we'd be sailing
Out under the southern cross

I can hear you calling
Wandering boy, come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon

Who am I fooling?
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again

Who am I fooling?
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again
I could sail forever
And never find that island again

And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion
You'd come around

[Chorus]
And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep sayin' you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

[Verse 2]
Now this home we have built is still standing
It's foundation is on solid ground
And do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn... it... down?

[Chorus]
And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep sayin' you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

[Bridge]
We can't just block it out, we've got to talk it out
Until our hearts get back in touch
I need your love I miss it, I can't go on like this
It hurts too much

[Chorus]
And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep sayin' you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

[Outro]
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
To the hard rock bottom... of your heart

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh

1479,Don Williams,33,Just As Long As I Have You,1990,"

Well, I love to wander
On a sandy shore
And I love to wander
Down the streets of towns
I've never been before
Take me somewhere out of reach
Lie in unfamiliar sheets
And hear the ocean roar
Ask for more I could not do
Just as long as you're there too

Just as long as I have you
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too
I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you are
'Cause with you is where I belong

--- Instrumental ---

I've just got to have you
To make my life complete
I've just got to have you
There to be a part of everything I see
In the windows I walk past
In the mirror in the morning
In my photographs
In the candlelite cafes
Let me always see your face

Oh, it really doesn't matter
Just where the road leads
To the top of a mountain
Or down to the sea

Just as long as I have you
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too
I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you are
'Cause with you is where I belong

Just as long as I have you
Just as long as I have you...

"
1480,Baillie And The Boys,34,Perfect,1990,"

I don't want half hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares
Life is too short to play silly games
I promised myself I won't do that again

It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less
It's got to be perfect

Young hearts are foolish they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away
Well, I have been foolish too many times
And now I'm determined I'm gonna get it right

It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less

"
1481,Patty Loveless,35,Chains,1990,"

Bought a ticket to Seattle but I can't get to the plane
Everytime I leave you I keep running out of chain
I hunger for your love it never gives me any slack
But if I ever break away, I'm never coming back to these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains

You never try to hold me 'till you see me walking out
I guess you'd rather be with me than ever be without
You call me back and kiss me and my heart begins to sink
When I know that all you're doing's
Taking up another link in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains

Love was never meant to be a one-way street
I was never meant to be falling at your feet
You got me where you want me
And I don't know what to do
You don't belong to me but I belong to you in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking
Cold, hard, lonely making chains...

1482,Southern Pacific,36,I Go To Pieces,1990,"

[Verse 1]
When I see her walking down the street
I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes look the other way
But they don't listen to a word I say

[Chorus]
And I, I go to pieces and I wanna cry
I go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

[Verse 2]
I tell my arms they'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care
They reach for her but she's not there

[Chorus]
And I, I go to pieces and I wanna cry
I go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

[Bridge]
Well I remember what she said when she said
""Goodbye baby, we'll meet again soon maybe
Well but until we do, all my best to you""
I'm so lonely, I think about her only

[Verse 3]
I go to places we used to go
Oh but I know she'll never show
Well she hurt me so much inside
Now I hope she is satisfied

[Chorus]
And I, I go to pieces and I wanna cry
I go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by
I go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by
I go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by
I go to pieces and I cry

1483,Paul Overstreet,37,Seein' My Father In Me,1990,"

Last night we brought the children by to visit their Grandpa
And it's plain to see they're truly part of him
While we were there
Their Grandma took out some old photographs
Man, he sure looked a lot like me back then

I'm seein' my father in me
I guess that's how it's meant to be
And I find I'm more and more like him each day
I notice I walk the way he walks
I notice I talk the way he talks
I'm startin' to see my father in me

And today I took my wife for a walk
Down that old dirt road
Where my Daddy took my Mom so many times
And we found the time
To mention things we never had before
And we shared some thoughts about the family life

Yeah, I'm seein' my father in me
I guess that's how it's meant to be
And I find I'm more and more like him each day
I notice I walk the way he walks
I notice I talk the way he talks
I'm startin' to see my father in me

And now lookin' back I can recall the times we disagreed
When I could not take hold of his old fashioned ways
And the more I tried to prove him wrong
The more I proved him right
Now I know why he still stood by me
When I went through that stage

I'm seein' my father in me
I guess that's how it's meant to be
And I find I'm more and more like him each day
I notice I walk the way he walks
I notice I talk the way he talks
I'm startin' to see my father in me

And I'm happy to see my father in me

1484,Eddie Rabbitt,38,On Second Thought,1990,"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a man does things without half thinking
And what I saw I did not understand
I called you names and said some things that hurt you
And in the heat I started walking out that door

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I know it's not your fault that you're so pretty
And that you turn the head of every man
I understand
But when I saw you dancing with him I just lost it
I started thinking I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge?]
But when I saw you dancing with him I just lost it
I started thinking I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

Yes you're the only one I'll always be in love with

"
1485,Garth Brooks,39,Not Counting You,1990,"

[Verse 1]
When loving turns to parting, I'm always the first to leave
'Cause when it comes to heartaches I'd rather give than to receive
I've never cried myself to sleep just praying I'll get through
I've never lost at love not counting you

[Chorus]
Not counting you, I've never had a heartache
Not counting you, I never have been blue
There's no exceptions to the rule
I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you

[Verse 2]
I've never got down on my knees and asked the Lord above
If He would only bring to me the one I'm dreaming of
Begging to be taken back and swearing I'll be true
Has never crossed my mind not counting you

[Chorus]
Not counting you, I've never had a heartache
Not counting you, I never have been blue
There's no exceptions to the rule
I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you

[Outro]
There's no exceptions to the rule
I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you
No, I've never lost at love not counting you

1486,The Oak Ridge Boys,40,No Matter How High,1990,"

When I was a young boy I would dream about life
And wonder just how sweet it would be
But baby I got lucky when I met you that night
Now you'll always have this promise from me

No matter how high I get
I'll always look up to you
You’ll always be number one
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high I get

Up here on the mountain it gets crazy sometimes
So crazy I don't know what to do
When I've had it up to here with all of their lies
I can count on you to tell me the truth

No matter how high I get
I'll always look up to you
You’ll always be number one
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high I get

You are the one that turned me around
You help me keep my feet on the ground

No matter how high I get
I'll always look up to you
You’ll always be number one
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high

No matter how high I get
I'll always look up to you
You’ll always be number one
I'll settle for number two
You've always been there for me
Baby, I must confess
I'll always look up to you
No matter how high

No matter how high I get
I'll always look up to you

1487,Conway Twitty,41,Fit To Be Tied Down,1990,"

I've always been the travelin' kind
Another town was on my mind
It's not my fault that I was just
Born with a case of wonder lust

But I'm changin' fast
You'll put it all in my past
No more running around
Feel like I'm fit to be tied down

I've loved some women in my time
So I'll leave some broken hearts behind
I know they'll cuss me that much more
But I've found what I've been searchin' for

Yeah, I'm changin' fast
You'll put it all in my past
No more running around
I'm finally fit to be tied down

Feel like I'm fit to be tied down

1488,Ricky Skaggs,42,Hummingbird,1990,"

Got tired of livin' in that one horse town
When to the station flagged that hummingbird down
I didn't even call to say goodbye
I couldn't stand to see that little girl cry
Now I'm walkin' to the city gonna make my name
Those lights were callin' me to fortune and fame
I had to ride that hummingbird just let me ride that hummingbird
I'm gonna make it now just any day
I've got this guitar and I came to play
Lyin' here lonely knowin' what I lost
My heart keeps asking was it worth the cost
Now ain't it funny how that always seems
Once you're standing there and the grass ain't so green
Why did I ride that hummingbird why did I ride that hummingbird
Oh today she called me on the telephone
She said hey country boy you been gone too long
And now I'm standin' at the station looking down the line
Here comes that hummingbird and she's right on time
I'm gonna ride that hummingbird just let me ride that hummingbird
I'm gonna ride just let me ride that hummingbird

1489,Foster & Lloyd,43,Is It Love,1990,"

Hello baby, how you doin'? Looks like it's you and me again
Maybe this time we'll wind up workin' it out in the end
We've been down this road before, more than once around the block
Baby, all this back and forth gets crazy and it's gotta stop
So when I ask you if you love me baby, don't say maybe
Why you gotta make it so tough? Is it me, is it you or is it love?
I hear it happens every day and even to the best of friends
I swear I never saw it comin', I just felt you gettin' under my skin
I've known you long enough to know, you feel it just the same as me
It gets real scary but I think that we both like the things we're startin' to see
So when I ask you what you're really feelin', starin' at the ceilin'
I don't think I'm askin' too much, is it me, is it you or is it love?
Don't you wonder what you're really feelin' while your heads a reelin'
Don't you think enough is enough, is it me, is it you or is it love?
Is it me, is it you or is it love? Is it me, is it you or is it love?

[Verse 1]
Hey baby tell me what we're gonna do
It's getting crazy and I need some help from you
We were so connected that you were a part of me
Now I feel an emptiness right to the heart of me

[Chorus]
But you pretend and I pretend
That everything is fine
And though we should be at an end
It's so hard admittin'
When it's quittin' time

[Verse 2]
Hey baby I'm running out of things to say
Please don't hate me this feeling just won't go away
Now we're spending all our time caught in a fantasy
Just trying to keep in mind the way it used to be

[Chorus]
But you pretend and I pretend
That everything is fine
And though we should be at an end
It's so hard admittin'
When it's quittin' time

But you pretend and I pretend
That everything is fine
And though we should be at an end
It's so hard admittin'
When it's quittin' time

[Verse 1]
Just got home late last night
This old town was a welcome sight
I couldn't wait to see you again
Oh how long it's been

[Verse 2]
When I opened the door, looking all around
You were nowhere to be found
I called our friends just to see
If they might know where you might be

[Chorus]
Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is nobody's talking about

[Verse 3]
I started looking, looking for you
I just didn't know what else to do
Every place I went, it was always the same

[Verse 4]
I just say your name and they turn away
Like they did not hear
What they're not saying is all too clear
In their eyes I see the sympathy
I know there's something they're not telling me

Nobody's talking, nobody's talking straight
I ask about you and they hesitate
But sooner or later, I'm gonna find out
Whatever it is nobody's talking about

1493,The Charlie Daniels Band,47,Mister DJ,1990,"

[Verse]
Mister DJ won't you please play me a song?
Play it for an old boy who's a long, long way from home
With a thousand miles ahead and a thousand miles behind
A dollar in his pocket and a woman on his mind
You can pick out almost anything you choose
Play 'Sweet Home Alabama' or let Waylon sing the blues
I don't care what kind of music just as long as it sounds tough
Don't play any hurting songs because I feel bad enough
Now don't get the wrong impression, I ain't meaning to complain
But it would be Sunday morning and I guess it had to rain
I was doing pretty good until I heard that darned old train
Going who knows where
And I guess the combination's got me feeling kinda low
And all I've got to cheer me up is this all night radio
Why don't you play us something hot and let this eighteen wheeler
Roll my blues away
Well, I called her from a phone booth in St. Paul
When I asked her if she loved me, I got no reply at all
And if that's the way she wants it, that's the way it's going to be
It might hurt a little while but that's all right with me
I've been jamming gears and wondering what went wrong
And then I turned on my radio and I heard a country song
And it kinda keeps me moving, helps me roll on down the line
But when you played that hurting song I almost started crying
Willie drowned in 'Whiskey River' with Hank Jr's rowdy friends
The Oak Ridge Boys sang 'Elvira', Ricky played the mandolin
Them old boys from Alabama put the pedal to the metal
And let it roll, roll on
And I started feeling bad when George stopped loving her today
Why don't you let old Mickey Gilly get down on them eighty eight's
Come on and play us something hot and let this eighteen
Wheeler roll my blues away

[Outro]
Hey Mister DJ, hey Mister DJ[x2]

1494,Alabama,48,Southern Star,1990,"

Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine
And show me the way to get home
Well I'm blue-collar branded, and stuck in a mill
Hard work is a way of life for me
Well I'm too young to live like I'm over the hills
And too old to be wild and free

My heart is onward bound
I'm rolling with the feeling and I can't slow down
I need a guiding light
Shining down to lead me through the night
Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine
And show me the way to get home

Oh, hey my D.J. friend, would you play me one more song
And let my mind just go and drift away
Now we all have a dream....and a place where we belong
Somewhere we can go and escape

My heart is onward bound
I'm rolling with the feeling and I can't slow down
....I need a guiding light
Shining down to lead me throught the night
Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine
And show me the way to get home

Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine
And show me the way to get home...

1495,Restless Heart,49,Fast Movin' Train,1990,"

She had a long line of lovers
Mostly the gambling kind
I didn't want to be like the others
And get left behind
I heard about her bad reputation
And how she had a heart of stone
How she'd give a man
A moment of pleasure
To get what she want

I had a weakness for her kind of woman
I could never deny
I knew I would never see it coming
Until I was lost in her eyes
The more I tried to keep her at a distance
The more I became aware
She was breaking down my resistance
Till I no longer cared

Tonight I saw the red red rose
In a yellow moon
Shining on a silhouette
Lying in the shadows of my bedroom
I knew it when we made love
And I couldn't quit calling her name
And I've been hit by another fast movin' train
I've been hit by another fast movin' train

I wondered as I lay there and held her
Why can't this be real?
Why the fear wouldn't let me tell her
How could she make me feel
I doubt it if she would even be around
When the moment comes
I waited till she fell asleep
To whisper
Baby, look what you've done

Tonight I saw the red red rose
In a yellow moon
Shining on a silhouette
Lying in the shadows of my bedroom
I knew it when we made love
And I couldn't quit calling her name
And I've been hit by another fast movin' train

Tonight I saw the red red rose
In a yellow moon
Shining on a silhouette
Lying in the shadows of my bedroom
I knew it when we made love
And I couldn't quit calling her name
And I've been hit by another fast movin' train

Well, your office called to say you wouldn't be long
Since when did your boss get a jukebox of his own?
When I called to see how long you'd be they said you'd been long gone
You're headed right in the wrong direction if you wanna come home

Well, you're leaving clues that any ole fool can see
Honey, you're the fool if you think your foolin' me
If you wanna go just let me know, we can sure enough get it all
You're headed right in the wrong direction if you wanna come home

Chorus:
If you want to keep your home you better straighten up your act
'Cause honey, I can love you, I can even help you pack
If you turn around, and come home now, I just might not be gone

Well, your headed right in the wrong direction honey, if you wanna come home...

1497,Doug Stone,1,In A Different Light,1991,"

Verse 1:
Every morning I watch you
Walk into the office
In your business suit
And matching shoes
With your hair pulled up neatly
You tug at your glasses
And you sit down
Just three desks down
And I watch you in the florescent glare
And my mind drifts away somewhere
And I see

Chours:
You
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind
You're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night

Verse 2:
There's girls at the office
The guys always notice
When they walk by
But you're not the type
They don't know what I know
Or somethings' just don't show
Through tailored tweads
And that's fine with me
Let them all think what they want to
As for me when I look at you
I see

Chours:
You
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind
You're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night

Chours
Baby it's you
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes

We both said some things I know we never meant
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went
If I know you, you're probably wondering what to do
You're thinking that I'm gone for good, if I know you

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too
And I'll come running back to you, if I know me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart
Forgetting if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said
Truth be known, you're dying, crying, lying there in bed

If I know me, and I know me

It was seven hundred fence posts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was raining, sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

[Chorus]
I'd start walking your way, you'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground if we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

[Verse 2]
It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
Standing in the back yard reminding me and you
That if we don't see eye to eye there's something we can do

[Chorus]
I'd start walking your way, you'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground if we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

[Bridge]
Babe I love the way we work it out
That's what love is all about

[Chorus]
I'd start walking your way, you'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground if we'd both give a little
Ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

I'd start walking your way, you'd start walking mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine

Wants Dad to watch him play
And Daddy knows he's waiting so he hurries on his way

She whispers words of hope to help her husband to hold on;
She takes time with the children making sure they know she cares
She's more than just a momma, she's the answer to their prayers

'Cause you know heroes come in every shape and size
Making special sacrifices for others in their lives
No one gives 'em medals, the world don't know their names

Now I don't pretend to know you but I'll bet it's safe to say
There's someone out there somewhere looking up to you today
And they see everything you do except for your mistakes
You may not think you measure up but you got all it takes

Making special sacrifices for others in their lives

1501,Dwight Yoakam,5,You're The One,1991,"

[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Verse 1]
Now you're back calling me with open arms
What happened to the one you met with all that charm
You say he's gone
And you're alone
Well that's a shame
But if you think real hard
I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Verse 2]
You're begging me to think about the love we shared
Yet it seems to me not too long ago you didn't care
The love you left
No longer lives
Within my heart
The game you played
So recklessly
Tore it all apart

[Chorus]
You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

[Tag]
Oh tell me how's it feel now that you're the one
How's it feel to be the one
How's it feel now that you're the one it's happenin' to

"
1502,Mark Chesnutt,6,Blame It On Texas,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Been havin' a ball since I was a boy in Beaumont
Love that town, but I just couldn't stay
Two stepped all the way to Amarillo
Shuffled my way into Santa Fe
Just had to see the sun set out in Frisco
The Golden Gate is great, but it ain't home
Give me a rodeo

[Chorus]
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me
I am who I am and that's what I'm gonna be
You can say what you wanna say about my insanity
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me

[Verse 2]
Met a girl out in eastern Oklahoma
Her daddy was a Tulsa millionaire
With miles and miles of oil wells, he'd leave her
All a man could want was waitin' there
But one night while she lay sleepin' I slipped away
Like no man in his right mind would do
Call me a fool

[Chorus]
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me
I am who I am and that's what I'm gonna be
You can say what you wanna say about my insanity
Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me

"
1503,Ronnie Milsap,7,Are You Lovin' Me Like I'm Lovin' You,1991,"

Have you ever felt like every eye's on you
Well, that's the way I feel when you walk into a room
And have you ever felt like making love all day
Well, that's the way I feel when you're loving me this way

And I wonder what it is to feel like you
To know someone worships every thing you do
Oh, and even though I know your love is true, yes I do
Sometimes I wonder if you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?

Have you ever loved so much it hurt inside
Well, that's the only way my love can be described
And have you ever known how cold this world can be?
Well, all I know is how cold it was until you came to me

Oh, and I wonder what it is to feel like you
To know someone worships every thing you do
Oh, and even though I know your love is true, yes I do
Some times I wonder are you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?

Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Oh, I wonder, are you lovin' me like I'm lovin' you?
Oh, I wonder?...

"
1504,Joe Diffie,8,If The Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets),1991,"

Diablo motors had a hell of a sale, downtown yesterday
Word got around, no money down, take years and years to pay
When I got there the lot was bare, but the salesman said hold on
For a little cash, I got ta two-tone Nash out behind the barn

If the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine
With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime
If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine

Well he said friend it ain't the end let's see what I can do
If you own a home, I've got a loan, tailor made for you
Then above the racket a voice in my jacket said, ""I'll tote the note.""
The devil made me do it, talked me in to it, and that was all she wrote

If the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine
With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime
If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine

They say debt is a bottomless pit where the devil likes to play
I'd sell my soul to get out of this hole, but there'd be hell to pay

If the Devil danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine
With a nine foot grand, a ten piece band and a twelve girl chorus line
I'd raise some loot in a three piece suit, give 'em one dance for a dime
If the Devil Danced in empty pockets, he'd have a ball in mine

1505,Dolly Parton With Ricky Van Shelton,9,Rockin' Years,1991,
1506,Garth Brooks,10,The Thunder Rolls,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 4]
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again""
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

1507,The Oak Ridge Boys,11,Lucky Moon,1991,"

I was there in the very next room
She thought I was down the hall
She was talking on the phone like women do
She didn't know I could hear at all

I heard her say to her very best friend
He doesn't love me like I did back then
She said lately I've been so alone
So tomorrow morning I'll be gone

Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I've got one more chance to make things right
We've gotta make her want to stay
It's up to me and you, lucky moon

Make reservations at her favourite restaurant
Candle light and expensive wine
Try to let her know that she's the one that I want
Gotta show her while I've still got time

I can't believe how stupid I've been
God knows I love her like I did back then
Better take to heart her warning
Somehow change her mind by morning

Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I've got one more chance to make things right
We've gotta make her want to stay
It's up to me and you, lucky moon

The first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I pray she might
Find a little magic in the moonlight

Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I've got one more chance to make things right
We've gotta make her want to stay

Lucky moon stay out tonight, sunlight stay away
I've got one more chance to make things right
We've gotta make her want to stay
It's up to me and you, lucky moon

Lucky moon
Lucky moon

1508,Clint Black,12,One More Payment,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Ain't that the way the luck goes
Seems like it never can be found
Break my back to make those bank notes
Payin' on an almost always broken down
Fix that car nine ways to Sunday
And it won't start again when Monday rolls around

[Verse 2]
Ain't that the way the rent goes
Seems like it's never goin' down
And that banker's bound to foreclose
At this rate, I'll lose my interest in this town
Paint the walls, mend the windows
'Bout the time the roof comes crumblin' to the ground

[Chorus]
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Stretchin' my credit out of line
Well I may not get ahead but now I won't be far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine
We're gonna swing it

[Verse 3]
Ain't that the way the heart goes
Seems they just attack without a sign
My mind's been on vacation
And my body's been workin' overtime
But I've done all that I can do
There's just one more balance due before it's mine

[Chorus]
I've been footin' the bill for some time
Step by step and line by dotted line
Well I haven't bought the farm yet but I'm not that far behind
I've got one more payment and it's mine

[Tag]
One more payment and it's mine
One more payment and it's mine
One more, one more, one more Lord

"
1509,Kathy Mattea,13,Time Passes By,1991,"

Dreams drift away like leaves on the water
They roll down the river and slip out of sight
Too many times we do what we ought
Put off 'till tomorrow what we'd really rather do tonight
And later realize

Time passes by
People pass on
At the drop of a tear
They're gone
Let's do what we dare
Do what we like
And love while we're here
Before time passes by

Thoughts are like pennies we keep in our pockets
They're never worth nothing 'til we give them away
Love's like a promise in an unopened letter
Where nights full of pleasure seldom see the light of day
When life gets in the way

Time passes by
People pass on
At the drop of a tear
They're gone
Let's do what we dare
Do what we like
And love while we're here
Before time passes by

Time passes by
People pass on
At the drop of a tear
They're gone
Let's do what we dare
Do what we like
And love while we're here
Before time passes by

1510,Lorrie Morgan,14,We Both Walk,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Here you are on the porch again
With your hat in your hand and a guilty grin
Baby I ain't gonna fall for that, just because I always have
And I'm not the only one who won't be taken it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor

[Verse 2]
Whenever you get that itch to go
You think I just sit and wait at home
But I've walked miles behind these walls
Without getting anywhere at all
And I think I've had enough of going down that road

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor

[Chorus]
Don't you try to come through my door
I can't watch you leave anymore
When you go we both walk
When you go we both walk
You walk away and I walk the floor
You walk away and I walk the floor

1511,Alabama,15,Down Home,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days, that's a special way of life

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Verse 2]
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Bridge]
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised
Down home
Down home

[Chorus]
Folks know
If there fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Outro]
Down home
Way down home
Down home
Down home
Way down home
Down home

1512,Travis Tritt,16,Drift Off To Dream,1991,"

(Travis Tritt/Stewart Harris)

I sit here surrounded by people and lights
Alone with my drink at the bar
You've been here forever, so clear in my mind
I just don't know where you are
I know I'll find you but girl 'til I do
This is my love song for you

Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms

You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street
But there'll be a hunger deep in your eyes
That I'll recognize when we meet
It might take hours or it might take years
But this is the song you will hear

Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms

"
1513,Randy Travis,17,Point Of Light,1991,"

There is a point when you cannot walk away
When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say
There is a point you must decide, just to do it 'cause it's right
That's when you become a point of light
There is a darkness that everyone must face
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light
There are heroes, whose names we never hear
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry, reaching out to save the land
Reaching out to help their fellow man
There are dreamers, who are making dreams come true
Taking time to to teach the children, there's nothing they can't do
Giving shelter to the homeless, giving hope to those without
Isn't that what this land's all about?
One by one, from the mountains to the sea
Points of light are calling out to you and me
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light

1514,The Judds,18,One Hundred And Two,1991,"

There's one hundred and one
Little reasons why
I should leave you here
Say goodbye
But I just can't seem
To say we're through
And the reasons why
Are one hundred and two

One hundred and one
Little tears fall
And every drop
Makes me feel so small
But as hard as I try
I can't leave you
And the reasons why, baby
Are one hundred and two

I'm countin' up
The times I've cried
The times you'd leave
The times you lied
And everyday
I'm keeping score
When it all adds up
I need you more

One hundred and one
Lonely nights
You leave me here
Now, honey, that ain't right
But, still I forgive
Everything you do
And the reasons why
Are one hundred and two

Yeah, the reasons why baby
Are one hundred and two

There's one hundred and one
Little reasons why
But, one hundred and two
Keeps me by your side

1515,Tanya Tucker,19,Oh What It Did To Me,1991,"

I saw you tonight
In her arms so tight
I watched as she held you tenderly

You say when she held you
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

You say when she kissed you
You didn't feel a thing
Well, I felt enough for all three

You want me to believe
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

And I felt the warm tears
Roll slowly down my face
As I watched another
Slowly take my place

And now it's all over
You want me to forget
And pretend that things are like they used to be

That it was just a kiss
That did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me

You want me to believe
It did nothing to you
But oh, what it did to me, to me

[Verse 1: Nikki Nelson]
Gather around me and lend an ear
'Cause I got something you ought to hear
I'm telling you that you ought to fear
A certain kind of love

[Verse 2: Nikki Nelson]
Now it can strike in the day or night
And just as quick as a rattler's bite
You've got a case of love at first sight
And it's what you're dyin' of

[Chorus #1:  Nikki Nelson, Cactus Moser, Curtis Stone, Jack Daniels]
It's just bing bang boom, one two three
You're feeling normal as you can be
And then bing bang boom, lickety split
It doesn't come on bit by bit
It gets instantly in full swing
And it's bing bang boom

[Verse 3: Nikki Nelson]
Now I was footloose and fancy free
I had respect, I had dignity
Then this thing got a hold of me
And it still will not let go

[Verse 4: Nikki Nelson]
I walked in and my heartbeat jumped
My hair stood up and my skin goosebumped
My mind went blank and my IQ slumped
And my judgment hit the road

[Chorus #2: Nikki Nelson, Cactus Moser, Curtis Stone, Jack Daniels]
It was bing bang boom, one two three
I fell the second he looked at me
It was bing bang boom, lickety split
It didn't come on bit by bit
It was instantly in full swing
It was bing bang boom

[Verse 5: Nikki Nelson]
And now my obligations slide
I do not even care
And I spend all my waking hours
Walking on thin air

[Nikki, Cactus, Curtis, Jack]
So friends you'd best beware

[Verse 6: Nikki Nelson]
'Cause that's exactly how you'll behave
If you get hit with this tidal wave
And you won't even have time to save
Your sinking sanity

[Chorus #1: Nikki, Cactus, Curtis, Jack]
It's just bing bang boom, one two three
You're feeling normal as you can be
And then bing bang boom, lickety split
It doesn't come on bit by bit
It gets instantly in full swing
And it's bing bang boom
Bing bang boom
Bing bang boom
Bing bang boom

It gets instantly in full swing
And it's bing bang boom

[Verse 1]
I'm standing at the crossroads in life, and I don't know where to go
You know you've got my heart babe, but my music's got my soul
Let me play it one more time, I'll tell the truth and make it rhyme
And hope they understand me

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake
Feed Jake

[Verse 2]
Now Broadway's like a sewer, bums and hookers everywhere
Wino passed out on the sidewalk, doesn't anybody care?
Some say he's worthless, just let him be
But I for one would have to disagree
And so would their mamas

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, and pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake
Feed Jake

[Verse 3]
Now If you get an ear pierced, some will call you gay
But if you drive a pick-up, they'll say ""No, you must be straight""
What we are and what we ain't, what we can and what we can't
Does it really matter?

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, and pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake
Feed Jake
If I die before I wake, feed Jake (x3)

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

[Verse 1]
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request

[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

[Verse 2]
I ain't got nothing
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
Ain't nothing like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

[Chorus]
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear George Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

There's no mistakin' what's taken place here
I can't pretend anymore
You know that I love you, but its not enough
To keep you away from my door
Now its too late to wonder what's left to be tried
Your mind's made up and my hands are tied

It's just one of those things
That I can't do nothing about
Your love is something that
I'm gonna have to learn to live without
I could beg, I could plead and get down on my knees
But I think I've finally figured it out
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about

So bring on the tears and bring on the heartaches
Let me get on with my pain
If this is good-bye then let's get it over
There's nothing left to explain
Now God knows I've tried, I've tried for so long
What's left of my heart will have to be strong

It's just one of those things
That I can't do nothing about
Your love is something that
I'm gonna have to learn to live without
I could beg, I could plead and get down on my knees
But I think I've finally figured it out
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about

Well it's all I can stand, but it's out of my hands
Your leaving is leaving more room for doubt
It's just one of those things
I can't do nothing about

In the stillness of the dawn
Our love is dead and gone
The sunrise warms my heart
With memories of you
It's the sweetest thing - remembering

There's a picture in the hall
That I'm leaving on the wall
'Cause there's a look in your eyes
That always made me fall apart
It's the sweetest thing - remembering

When I close my eyes to cry
I can't help but feel a smile
'Cause I think of you and I forget
It hurt to say goodbye

Chorus:
But after all that we've been through
It's amazing to me
The sweetest thing's remembering
Oh the sweetest thing - remembering

We wanted love to last forever
And the good lord knows we tried
But when the rain came pouring down
There was no place left to hide

It's the sweetest thing - remembering

1523,Ricky Van Shelton,27,I Am A Simple Man,1991,"

I don't know why you want to start with me
I ain't n-n-nothing far as I can see
And I'm worn out from working too hard
Why don't you give me a break?

I know that lately things ain't been so good
I'll make it up just like I told you I would
But I'm tired and I want to sit down
To ease this old backache

You say you're having trouble figuring me
I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man

I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
I am a simple man

You say we've got some things to talk about
A lot of problems that we need to work out
But we just wind up fighting
Why don't you give it a rest?

I don't know what else I can say to you
I'm doing everything I know to do
And I can't give you anything more
When I'm giving my best

You say you're having trouble figuring me
I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man

I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
I am a simple man

I want a place I can lay my head
Soft woman and a warm bed
A little time off before I'm dead
I am just a simple man

You say you're having trouble figuring me
I don't believe I'm such a mystery
Mmm baby, what you get is what you see
I am a simple man

I want a job and a piece of land
Three squares in my frying pan
Don't seem so hard for me to understand
I am a simple man

You were there, the first time I stumbled
Will you be there each time I fall
Will you care for me forever
Darling promise you will love me most of all

You can count on me, I'll be true
Do you feel the same way I do
When times get hard, will you see me through
What I need to know, can I count on you

Will you still wear that band of gold
Say you'll be here always beside me
Will I still have your hand to hold

[Chorus]
You can count on me, I'll be true
Do you feel the same way I do
When times get hard, will you see me through
What I need to know, can I count on you

[Tag]
What I need to know, can I count on you

"
1525,Garth Brooks,29,Two Of A Kind  Workin' On A Full House,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's my lady luck, hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand
We live out in the country, hey, she's my little queen of the South
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Verse 2]
She wakes me every mornin' with a smile and a kiss
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist
She's my easy lovin' woman, I'm her hard-workin' man, no doubt
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Bridge 1]
Yeah, our pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up

[Verse 3]
Lord, I need that little woman like the crops need the rain
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together, if you know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Bridge 2]
This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind
Lord, the perfect combination is her heart and mine
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps

[Verse 4]
So draw the curtain, honey, turn the lights down low
We'll find some country music on the radio
I'm yours and you're mine, hey, that's what it's all about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

[Outro]
Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind, workin' on a full house

"
1526,Clinton Gregory,30,(If It Weren't For Country Music) I'd Go Crazy,1991,"

I sit here by the jukebox in this country bar
I gotta hear some fiddle and some steel guitar
A month ago my lovin' lady threw me out
And I don't know what to do, so I just do without

This old city brings me down, it ain't been good to me
But it's all that I can do to keep my sanity
But the future's lookin' bright, 'cause I'm finally feelin' right
And if it weren't for country music I'd go crazy

I got holes in my boots, I got holes in my jeans
Holes in my pockets, man you know what that means
Between the bar tab and the jukebox, my money's all been spent
And I'd vote for Merle Haggard for president
Play some Hank, play some Willie, play some Restless Heart
But don't play ""A Tender Lie"" 'cause I might fall apart
But the future's lookin' bright, 'cause I'm finally feelin' right
And if it weren't for country music I'd go crazy

I got holes in my boots, I got holes in my jeans
Holes in my pockets, man you know what that means
Between the bar tab and the jukebox, my money's all been spent
And I'd vote for Merle Haggard for president
Play some Hank, play some Willie, play some Restless Heart
But don't play ""A Tender Lie"" 'cause I might fall apart
But the future's lookin' bright, 'cause I'm finally feelin' right
And if it weren't for country music I'd go crazy

1527,Alan Jackson,31,I'd Love You All Over Again,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Has it been ten years
Since we said ""I do""
I've always heard marriage
Made one seem like two
But you're looking better
Than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in

[Chorus]
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said
""Til death do us part""
That seemed like forever
To a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up

[Chorus]
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

[Outro]
If tomorrow I found
One more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

1528,Vince Gill,32,Pocket Full Of Gold,1991,"

[Verse 1:]
He slipped the ring off his finger
When he walked in the room
And he found him some stranger
And promised her the moon
How many lies you must have told
You think you're a rich man

[Chorus:]
With your pocket full of gold

[Verse 2:]
For another man's treasure
You'd say anything
But is one night of pleasure
Worth the trouble you'll bring
Don't look so surprised
'Cause son I should know
I once was a rich man

[Chorus:]
With my pocket full of gold

[Verse 3:]
Some night you're gonna wind up
On the wrong end of a gun
Some jealous guy's gonna show up
And you'll pay for what you've done
What will it say on your tombstone
Here lies a rich man

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Yeah, here lies a rich man
With his pocket full of gold

"
1529,Reba McEntire,33,Fancy,1991,"

[Verse 1]
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""

[Verse 2]
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
Across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking mama, ""What do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you""

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your mama's gonna move you uptown

[Verse 3]
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama had been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was going to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

[Chorus]
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
She said, ""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""

[Verse 4]
It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea in a five room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

[Verse 5]
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
""Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
""Oh, here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down""
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, honey
Mama's gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did

"
1530,Marty Stuart,34,Till I Found You,1991,"

When I was a young man I thought I knew everything
But I didn't know nothing, till I found you
I used to get around some, I thought I'd seen everything
But I hadn't seen nothing, till I found you

Till I found you there was no light, nothing ever worked out right
Baby it's true, till I found you

Everybody's searching, they're trying to find something
But I don't need nothin', now I've found you
'Cause you're the only one love, the only one I'm sure of
And all I want is your love, now that I found you

Till I found you there was no light, nothing ever worked out right
Baby it's true, till I found you
Baby it's true, till I found

"
1531,Randy Travis,35,Heroes And Friends,1991,"

[Verse 1]
I ain't lived forever, but I've lived enough
And I've learned to be gentle, and I've learned to be tough
I've found only two things that last till the end
One is your heroes, the other's your friends

[Chorus]
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

[Verse 2]
I grew up with cowboys I watched on TV
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be
Years have gone by but now and again
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends

[Chorus]
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how it goes with heroes and friends

1532,Clint Black,36,Loving Blind,1991,"

[Verse 1]
Well I sit here all alone, no one's gonna do me wrong tonight
It seems I've been through it all, and there's no one I could call to get it right
And everywhere I go, everyone seems so
Settled in and sure of where they're goin'
Well I don't know what I need, since I've been freed
I'm a horse without a rider, and there's no one left to take the lead

[Chorus]
And I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
And I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothing there for me

[Verse 2]
Now there's a smile on my face, no there's no trace of the pain
I know I've been through it all, and I know those tears won't fall again
But, oh, the times I thought, someone's heart I'd caught
Well, I was fooled, oh, and I regret
I was so naive, oh, and I'd believe them when they'd tell me
That's as good as love can get

[Chorus]
And I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
And I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothin' there for me

[Outro]
And I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
And I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothin' there for me

"
1533,Don Williams,37,True Love,1991,"

Adam and Eve on a Saturday night
That's when the trouble started
She said Adam let's go for a bite
She led him through the garden

And ever since then we tried to make sense
Of this mystery emotion
But we might as well try to count the stars in the sky
Or those raindrops in the ocean

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

I was alone for so many nights
I really started to wonder
If I had run outa chances to find
A spell I could fall under
Then you walked in like in a Elvis film
You were singing Love Me Tender
I was a hypnotized by your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember

Chorus:
Well you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

And there is true love in a winkin' eye
And the sweet perfume that lingers
And it's a I love you on a new tattoo
And that diamond on her finger

Chorus:
Well, you know it's true love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well, it's hard to find and it's harder to keep
It's the thing we most desire

It's the true love we most desire...

"
1534,Billy Dean,38,Somewhere In My Broken Heart,1991,"

You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly, go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken heart

Girl, I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
When you finally do, I think you will see
It's somewhere in my broken
Somewhere in my broken
Somewhere in my broken heart

With this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you
With this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you

They used to call me a wanderer
Who never wanted to settle down

'Cause with this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you

With this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you
With this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you

[Verse 3]
Baby I never thought so much love
Could fit inside a little band of gold
But I'm telling you darlin'
I feel it in my heart, got it in my soul, girl

[Chorus]
And with this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you
With this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you
So with this ring I promise I'll always love ya, always love you

"
1536,Mark Collie,40,Let Her Go,1991,"

When her high-heels hit the floor, let her go
When she says she's out to go, let her go
There's an unspoken rule, every man should know:
You can't hold her, if you can't let her go

When she needs time on her own, let her go
Though it means you'll be alone, let her go
Ask anyone who's tried it, they'll say it so:
You can't hold her, if you can't let her go

If you can't let her go
How she's ever gonna know
Just how much she needs you
Just how much she means to you
If you can't be that strong
You're never gonna hold her...
For very long

When you see her with somebody new, let her go
And if she ran in front of you, let her go
Even if it breaks your heart, don't let it show:
'cause you can't hold her, if you can't let her go...

And if you can't hold her, let her go

1537,Shenandoah,41,I Got You,1991,"

[Verse 1]
We got married one afternoon in May
Never did see the light of day
On our honeymoon
We didn't have much when we started out
Your grandma's bed in a three room house
But we made do
And oh I got you, oh I got you

[Verse 2]
You could've had that boy you used to know
He's a millionaire from Ohio
Your mama told me so
When the best I could do was the factory
You didn't get much when you got me
Baby that's true
But oh I got you, oh I got you

[Bridge]
I got something that money can't buy
I cross my heart and hope to die
Don't need nothing that I can't afford
I got you and I thank the Lord

[Tag]
Now if all that's left is the rocking chair
I'll be fine knowing you'll be there, rocking too
Oh I got you, oh long as I got you
Oh I got you, oh I got you
Oh I got you, oh long as I got you

1538,Shenandoah,42,The Moon Over Georgia,1991,"

[Verse 1]
He owns a big estate just south of Savannah
And a high rise hotel in downtown Atlanta
Add half the state of Georgia to his name
She'd be set for life in his colonial manor
He laid the world at her feet on a silver platter
But all I had to offer her was the moon

[Chorus]
And she took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky than a gold mine
She took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the moon over Georgia

[Verse 2]
A little country house in need of expansion
It's a far cry from his south Georgia mansion
But we've got our own paradise
Shadows dancin' 'til dawn with a full moon shinin'
And those occasional clouds all have a silver linin'
There really must be something about that old yellow light

[Chorus]
She took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky than a gold mine
Yeah she took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the moon over Georgia
She took the moon over Georgia

1539,Rob Crosby,43,She's A Natural,1991,
1540,Patty Loveless,44,I'm That Kind Of Girl,1991,"

There's a man in a Stetson hat, howlin' like an alley cat
Outside my window tonight
Sayin', ""Baby, put on something hot, meet me in the parking lot
About a quarter to nine""

I get the feelin' that he's never read Romeo and Juliet
I'm gettin' tired of these one night stands
But if you wanna make a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

Let me tell you that I like my lovin' just as much as any woman
But I'm drawin' the line
A little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
I'm a sucker for a love-sick fool
The kind that carries all your books in school
I'm getting tired of these one night stands
But if you're lookin' for a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa
I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa

1541,Aaron Tippin,45,I Wonder How Far It Is Over You,1991,"

I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours
And I struck out across Texas, gonna walk it line to line
Now I'm halfway cross New Mexico, but you're still on my mind
And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on
As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you

I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time

I'm standing by the ocean, but you're still on my mind
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side

I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you

I parked my car beside the highway and I didn't lock the doors
Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours

1542,Hank Williams Jr.,46,If It Will It Will,1991,"

When I was a boy in school
Learning the Golden Rule
I had a crush on my teacher
She was a beautiful creature

When I look at kids today
I think of how we used to play
She taught all us boys and girls
This little song about the real, real world
She said now class

If it will it will, and if it won't it won't
If it does it does, yeah if it don't it don't
Some days are good some bad you know
That's the way it goes

Give the wheel of life a spin, see where it lands
Let your spirit fly free, enjoy yourself while you can
Don't be in a hurry and don't ever make plans

'Cause if it will it will, and if it won't it won't
If it does it does, hey if it don't it don't
Life is not always so smooth
And Murphy's Law is gonna rule

You know the river's gonna flow, wherever it wants to go
And if the rain wants to fall, you can't stop it at all
No one has ever had control over this world, don't you know?

'Cause if it will it will, and if it won't it won't
(If it will it will, if it won't it won't)
If it does it does, and if it don't it don't
(If it does it does, if it don't it don't)
Life is not always so smooth
And Murphy's Law is gonna rule

'Cause if it will it will, and if it won't it won't
(If it will it will, if it won't it won't)
If it does it does it does, if it don't it don't
(If it does it does, if it don't it don't)
No one has ever had control over this old world don't you know, ain't it so?

1543,Shelby Lynne,47,What About The Love We Made,1991,"

That old picture on the dresser goes with your things
The rocking chair in the corner goes with mine
You can take the bed and have the TV
And I'll keep the stereo if you don't mind
We've seperated everything between us
It's the kindest that we've been in a long, long time
But there's still one thing we've got left between us
And we don't know what to do, I wonder if we thought this through

What about the love we made?
She's upstairs in her room, cryin' over me and you
Lord we never meant to hurt her this way
We've divided everything me and you
Even her little heart right in two
Now what about the love we made?

We've told her at least a thousand times we love her
And no matter what happens that won't change
But who could blame her if she won't believe us
Aren't we the same ones who told her
She'd never see this day?
It filled us both with shame when she told her dolly
""Now promise me that you won't leave me too""
And it was more than I could take when she said ""Mommy
If there's something I've done wrong
Well, I'll be good for you""

Oh, what about the love we made?
She's upstairs in her room
Crying over me and you
Lord we never meant to hurt her this way
We've divided everything me and you
Even her little heart right in two
Now what about the love we made?
What about the love we made?

Hey, get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get goin'
Get rhythm, when you get the blues

[Verse 1]
[Martin Delray:]
A little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street
I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Martin Delray & Johnny Cash:]
Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues

A jumpin' rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind

Get rhythm, when you get the blues

[Verse 2]
[Johnny Cash:]
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be a'workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
He kept on a'poppin' and he said again

[Chorus 3]

Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon, get rhythm, when you get the blues

It does a million dollars worth of good for you

1545,Don Williams,49,Lord Have Mercy On A Country Boy,1991,"

(Bob McDill)

Well, I grew up wild and free
Walkin' these fields in my bare feet
There wasn't no place I couldn't go
With a twenty-two rifle and a fishing pole

Chorus:
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know its a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh Lord, have mercy on a country boy

--- Instrumental ---

When I was young I remember well
I'd hunt the wild turkey and the bob-white quail
The river was clear and deep back then
And fishin' lines tied to the willow limb

Chorus:
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know its a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh Lord, have mercy on a country boy

--- Instrumental ---

Well, they dammed the river, they dammed the stream
They cut down the cypress and the sweet gum trees
There's a laundra' mat and a barber shop
And now the whole meadow is a parkin' lot

Chorus:
Well, I live in the city but don't fit in
You know its a pity the shape I'm in
Well, I got no home and I got no choice
Oh Lord, have mercy on a country boy...

1547,Billy Ray Cyrus,1,Achy Breaky Heart,1992,"

[Verse 1]
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Verse 2]
You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Chorus]
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

[Chorus]
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh

1548,Sawyer Brown,2,Some Girls Do,1992,"

[Verse 1]
She turned up her nose as she walked by my Cadillac
From the corner of my eye I saw you and you laughed
You were sitting on the swing on your front porch
A-painting your nails like you were bored
And you yelled ""she was sure impressed with you""

[Chorus]
Well I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aww, but some girls do

[Verse 2]
I yelled and asked if you would like a ride
When we pulled out of your yard I bald a tire
You was laughing at me, I was doing James Dean
You was the prettiest girl I've ever seen
When you rolled your eyes and twirled my pink fur dice

[Chorus]
Well I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aww, but some girls do

[Bridge]
Well good ol' boys don't get no breaks
And the rich boys think they got what it takes
But there's someone for each of us, they say

[Chorus]
Well I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aww, but some girls do

[Chorus]
Well I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aww, but some girls do

[Outro]
I said some girls do
You know some girls do
Like boys like me
You know some girls do

"
1549,Collin Raye,3,Every Second,1992,"

Well listen dear I think it's clear
We need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been
Having second thoughts
Well I must confess in a way I guess that silly
Notion's true

'Cause every second you're not here with me I think of you'

Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask that I've had second thoughts I'd have to say
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favoritie music on and hold each other close
Don't worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

Every second, every minute, every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask that I've had second thoughts I'd guess I have to say
Every second, every minute, every hour of every day

Every second, every minute, I love you more and more eatch day

1550,Travis Tritt,4,Nothing Short Of Dying,1992,"

(Travis Tritt)

I should've told her more I loved her
I should've spent more time at home
But should haves really aren't important
Since the fact is now she's gone
I wish I'd listened to my conscience
When it said 'don't let her go'
And if she's wondering how I'm doing
Well, I think she oughta know

(That/And) I find myself praying
More than I ever did before
And I find my heart is breaking
Each time her memory slams the door
And I find myself crying
And trying to hold on
'Cause there ain't nothing short of dying
That's worse than being left alone

I thought I'd be just fine without her
I'd be happy a free man
But the hurtin' side of lonesome
Is what I didn't understand
And the lessons that I'm learning
Lord, I'm learning awful well
'Cause nights I used to spend in Heaven
Have been replaced by nights of Hell

Repeat Chorus

There ain't nothing short of dying
That's worse than being left alone

"
1551,Ricky Van Shelton,5,Backroads,1992,"

I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind

Well, when I woke up this morning, well, I took me a look outside
It was plain to see it was one of those days tailor-made for taking a ride
So I went downstairs and cleared my head with coffee and cigarettes
And when it hit me right there, then my mind was set

Well, I phoned work and told 'em they're going to be a man short today
I got the sunny day blues, there's only one thing that's gonna make them go away
So I went out and I climbed into my big ol' Chevrolet
And with a turn of the key and a cloud of dust, I was on my way

I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind

Well, maybe I did maybe I didn't go and lose my job today
But you can take my cares, take my worries and blow them all away
For there comes a time in any man's life when he's got to break free
I got four good wheels and an endless road stretched out in front of me

I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind

I've got the radio blastin', I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads on the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin', hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads, all my troubles are behind

1552,Doug Stone,6,Come In Out Of The Pain,1992,"

I'd be lyin' if I said-
I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now
How much love you've missed

Im happy that you're sad- I know
That sounds so wrong
But darlin you must know
The pains gone on too loong

Come in out of the pain

Let me dry your teears
Hes been gone for daays
And ive loved you for yeears

Lay down in my arms
There ain't no shame
Dont just stand there girl-

Come in out of the pain

Well I know how, a heartache feels
Shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me
He'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain

But I can promise you that I can
Stop your paaaain

Come in out of the paain
And let me dry your teears
Hes been gone for days
And I've loved you for yeears

Ohh lay down in my arms

Dont just stand there girl-

"
1553,Brooks & Dunn,7,Neon Moon,1992,"

[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think:
This hurt inside of me ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Outro]
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

1554,McBride & The Ride,8,Sacred Ground,1992,"

[Verse 1]
We got married in high school
Had a baby when we turned eighteen
I bagged groceries in the daytime
At night I learned to fix TV's
When you come by things the hard way
Well you learn how to hold on tight
So don't think you can waltz in here
And take her without a fight

[Chorus]
This ain't just some neon love come lately
It's a precious thing you don't know nothing about
We were joined in the eyes of the Lord
In the eyes of our whole town
Why don't you leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground

[Verse 2]
I guess I took for granted
She would never look at someone else
Now I've got some patchin' up to do
Oh and I don't need your help
I know you're the leavin' kind
Well I sure hope you will
Before she goes and burns those bridges
It took so long to build

[Chorus]
Oh this ain't just some neon love come lately
It's a precious thing you don't know nothing about
We were joined in the eyes of the Lord
In the eyes of our whole town
Why don't you leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground

[Tag]
Go on and leave her alone
Why don't you leave her alone
Go on and leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground

1555,Trisha Yearwood,9,The Woman Before Me,1992,"

[Verse 1]
I can see you turn away
When I ask what for
You say it isn't anything
But I'm not sure
Something underneath the skin
Won't let you be
And you try to keep it in
But I can see

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in an argument
It will show
When you go a little farther than
You meant to go
I know you don't mean the things
That you say
I just wanna ease the pain
That's in your way

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

[Bridge]
If there are sorrows that bring back a tear
Don't let them keep us apart
You ought to know you've got nothing to fear
Here in my heart

[Verse 3]
'Cause you and I will never be
Like the past
Whatever kind of memories
That you have
Nothin's gonna hurt you now
Can't you see
I already made a vow
That I can keep

[Chorus]
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

1558,George Strait,12,Gone As A Girl Can Get,1992,"

[Verse 1]
Well I ain't seen her lately, and she never calls
She don't ask my friends about me, gives no clues at all
That a fire might still be burning yet
I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get

She don't even show up in my dreams at night
But my stubborn old memory keeps holding on tight
Sure makes it hard to forget
She's about as gone as a girl can get

[Chorus]
She's out of here, she disappeared without a trace
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face
Her destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight
Last seen heading right on out of my life
Like a stranger I ain't never met
She's about as gone as a girl can get

[Chorus]

"
1559,Garth Brooks,13,Papa Loved Mama,1992,"

[Verse 1]
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

[Chorus]
Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama’s in the graveyard, Papa’s in the pen

[Verse 2]
Well it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

[Bridge]
Well the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

[Chorus]
Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama’s in the graveyard, Papa’s in the pen

1560,Hal Ketchum,14,Past The Point Of Rescue,1992,"

Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how
Couldn't get enough of kissing, do you know how much you're missing
No you don't, but I do

The days like a slow train trickle by
And even the words that I write refuse to fly
All I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head, you see
Distractions are amusing, do you know how much you're losing
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do

I swore I'd never fall like this again
Fools like me never win, came to my knees again
Can't close the door on likely hood
Things might be just as good, I always believed they would
Gotta let your love invite me, baby do you think it might be
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do

But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you, do you know how much I love you
No you don't, but I do
I know you don't, but I do
I know you don't, but I do

1561,Mark Chesnutt,15,Old Flames Have New Names,1992,"

I left town two years ago and moved on up to Idaho
But swore that I'd be back again - Pick up where I left off, oh man
Left behind some lovely ladies
Grown up sexy Texas babies
I got back in town tonight
Anticipating much delight
I pulled out my black book and called up my old lovers
I got five newlyweds and two expectant mothers

All my old flames have new names
There's a lot of girls in town
Who tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with one of my old flames
But they've all got new names

My sexy little dirt road sport is now called Mrs. Davenport
My pretty little black-eyed Susie's now Mrs. Susan Van Der Hoosie
Rosie who could blow my mind is sister Rose on channel nine
The wildest lover of my life is now a federal judges wife
They don't want to recognize this old familiar face
I'm just a bad reminder of their wild and woolly days

All my old flames have new names
There's a lot of girls in town
Who tied the knot and settled down
I thought I'd start a fire with one of my old flames
But they've all got new names

1562,Alan Jackson,16,Midnight In Montgomery,1992,"

[Verse 1]
Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

[Verse 2]
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

[Verse 3]
Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Chorus]
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

[Outro]
Yeah, he's always singing there
Oh, Hank's always singing there

1563,Shenandoah,17,Rock My Baby,1992,"

After work, me and the boys
Go down to Killey's and we make some noise
Feed that old jukebox and play some air guitar
Well and there's nothin' wrong with shootin' pool
And having some fun and acting a fool
But this time I won't be going where they are
'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight
Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight
The girl sure has been working hard
I thank she's ready for some R 'n' R
Something to take her mind off everything
Champagne and a box of candy
A dozen roses might come in handy
To help loosen up those apron strings
'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
All day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight
Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight
If the roses and the candy do the trick
Tomorrow I may have to call in sick
'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight
Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight
Yeah, I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

Now, the first rule is that there ain't no rules
Some you win and some you lose
Just when you think that love is true
Somebody makes a fool out of you

You like it or not, one thing for sure
All is fair in love and war

You and me, we make love all night
And we end up in a knock down, drag out fight
We kick and we cuss and we scream and shout
Until we forgot what we're fightin' about

Kiss and makeup and make love some more
Cause all is fair in love and war

And now, anything goes when it come to love
Someone's going down when push comes to shove, yeah
It's a fight to the finish with no holds barred
Someone winds up with a broken heart
That's tough, that's real tough

Now baby, you know that I sure would grieve
If you were to ever leave me
I guess I'd have to find me someone new, yeah
Someone who's a little bit prettier than you

If we can't get along
We aught to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you
Get that cold cold heart

Set me free
Sign my release
I'm tired of being a
Villian of the peace

You've been giving me bad times
Tell me what'd I do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey, when it comes to you
Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you

You only get one life
And this I know
I want to get my licks
In now before I go

Fire of love
Is dead and cold
I got to satisfy
The hunger in my soul

You been giving me bad times
Tell me what'd I do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
Saying things that you didn't have to

If we can't get along
We aught to be a part
And I'm wondering where'd you
Get that cold cold heart

Set me free
Sign my release
I'm tired of being a
Villian of the peace

You been giving me bad times
Tell me what'd I do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you

"
1566,Wynonna,20,I Saw The Light,1992,"

I laid a red rose on your front porch
And wrote 'I love you' on a note
I rang the doorbell and turned to go
Baby when the curtains moved, I couldn't believe the view
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth, when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
So take your cheatin' hands off my red dress
'Cause I ain't wearin' this thing for you
I see you clearly now and your lies too
They say that love is blind, baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
Why baby why, should I listen to you?
I cry baby cry, now I'm walkin' out the door
They say that love is blind, baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight

"
1567,Randy Travis,21,I'd Surrender All,1992,"

I wake up to the silence
In a room where I once heard ""Good Morning Dear""
I never thought I'd miss the early morning smell
Of hairspray in the air
All the little things I used to take for granted
Now I miss them most of all
Ain't it funny how a woman walking out the door
Can bring a man to crawl

And I'd surrender all
To bring you back to me
Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all

Now I'm staring out the window
Praying every passing car would bring you home
So I could take you in my arms
And give the kind of love
You should have known

And I'd surrender all
To bring you back to me
Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all
If you would only call, I'd surrender all

"
1568,Suzy Bogguss,22,Aces,1992,"

My old friend said to me
That ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well I don't know, could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel undermined and hurt again
Now, don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything you start

You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

And I guess I said I couldn't see
How things could turn out like they've come to be
And if I lied, and if I knew
I was only trying to think of you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me, can't you see
I would never wanna do what it seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away
Don't let this be the reason you would walk away

"
1569,Reba McEntire,23,The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia,1992,"

[Verse 1]
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
He said, ""Hi, what's new?""
And Wo said, ""Sit down I got some bad news that's going to hurt""

[Verse 2]
Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride isn't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth""
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself""

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 3]
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home because he didn't live far - you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

[Verse 4]
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

[Chorus 2]
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

[Verse 5]
The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 6]
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister doesn't miss when she aims her gun

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

1570,Michelle Wright,24,Take It Like A Man,1992,"

Boy meets girl
It's a delicate thing
So much time spent wondering
If what you see is what you get
I keep looking for a friend and a lover
When I find one
He ain't the other

Sometimes I just wanna quit
One wants a maid
One needs his mother
They either want space or they wanna smother me
And my poor ol' heart needs somebody who can

Take it like a man
Steady and strong
Not a lot of fuss and carrying on
True to a promise I can write in stone

Take it like a man
Who knows about love
And every little thing that a girl dreams of
Someone wise enough to understand
If you want this woman's heart
Take it like a man

I met somebody the other night
Started thinking he was Mr. right.... wrong
I might have never known
If a friend hadn't brought it to my attention
He's got a wife he forgot to mention
Girl, leave that fool alone

I keep hoping and telling myself
Somewhere there's one good one left
'Cause my poor heart needs somebody who can

Take it like a man
Steady & strong
Not a lot of fuss & carrying on
True to a promise I can write in stone

Take it like a man
Who knows about love
And every little thing that a girl dreams of
Someone wise enough to understand
If you want this woman's heart
Take it like a man

Take it like a man
Steady & strong
Not a lot of fuss & carrying on
True to a promise I can write in stone

Take it like a man
Who knows about love
And every little thing that a girl dreams of
Someone wise enough to understand
If you want this woman's heart
Take it like a man

Take it like a man
Honey, if ya want my heart
You gotta take it like a man

Take it like a man (fades out)

1571,Joe Diffie,25,Ships That Don't Come In,1992,"

I could tell he'd had a tough life
By the way he sat and stared
And me, I'd come to push and shove
So I pulled up a chair

We talked of roads untraveled
We talked of love untrue
Of strings that come unraveled
We were kings and kindred fools
And just when I'd hit bottom
That old man raised his glass
And said at least we had our chances
There's those who never have

So here's to all the soldiers
Who have ever died in vain
The insane locked up in themselves
The homeless down on Main
To those who stand on empty shores
And spit against the wind
And those who wait forever
For ships that don't come in

He said it's only life's illusions
That bring us to this bar
To pick up these old crutches
And compare each other's scars
'Cuz the things we're calling heartache
Hell, they're hardly worth our time
We bitch about a dollar
When there's those without a dime

And as he ordered one last round
He said I guess we can't complain
God made life a gamble
And we're still in the game

So here's to all the soldiers
Who have ever died in vain
The insane locked up in themselves
The homeless down on Main
To those who stand on empty shores
And spit against the wind
And those who wait forever
For ships that don't come in

1572,Aaron Tippin,26,There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio,1992,"

Some times she runs, some times she don't
More than once shes left me on the side of the road
The older she gets the slower we go
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
She needs a carburetor, a set of plug wires
Shes riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

I got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual antennas whippin' in the wind
Lord there ain't no country station that I can't tune in
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

I got stopped by a cop late last night, out of date tags and no taillights
He said I oughta run you in but im a lettin you go
Because There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
Got the best lookin gal in my hometown
I asked her last time that I took her out
Honey tell me what it is that makes you love me so
She said There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With your Radio

No she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a rolls
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

1573,Tracy Lawrence,27,Today's Lonely Fool,1992,"

What would you say if I told you I was sorry
And that Ive come to realize, life means nothing without you
Would you take my hand, would you forgive this man for ever doubting
Your love was true, and could you find it in your heart to let me try and
Make it up to you

Chorus:
Yesterdaya jealous man, today a lonely fool
I let love slip right through my hands
From all the hurt Ive handed you
Ive got to stop your love from dying
Or Ill be living proof
Cause yesterday's jealous man
Is todays lonely fool

Darlin, from now on Ill be proud when other men notice you
Instead of gettin mean and loud, like I used to do
Find some mercy in your heart
Then will make anoother start, at the love that we once new
I won't hurt you anymore Im gonna trust you now and never question you

Yesterday a jealous man, today a lonely fool
I let love slip right through my hands
From all the hurt Ive handed you
Ive got to stop your love from dying, or Ill be living proof
That yesterdays jealous man is todays lonely fool

Im todays lonely fool

Todays lonely fool

Stepped off the front porch

I don't stay out all night
I don't close down the bars
And i don't make a fool of myself
Well, i don't drink too much
And i don't get too loud
And i don't ever raise too much hell

But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That i haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what i might do
'cause if i've learned anything
There's a first time for everything

I don't call up old flames
'cause i don't have a blackbook
I don't spend all my time in the past
I don't wake up with strangers
'cause i don't sleep around
No i don't believe in love that won't last

But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That i haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what i might do

1576,Pam Tillis,30,Blue Rose Is,1992,"

Her lips and her dress, they're both ruby red
She thinks that's how you hide the pain you feel inside
And she comes out every night to soak up the neon light
Her perfume fills the air, people stop and stare, but

Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is willing to believe someone's lies
Now Blue Rose's petals have been crushed along the way
Oh, Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday

One more drink, one more dance, you might be her only chance
She needs someone to hold when the night is growing old
And if you don't mind the thorns, she'll take you in and keep you warm
Lying in the dark in a bed of broken hearts, 'cause

Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is willing to believe someone's lies
Now Blue Rose's petals have been crushed along the way
Oh, Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday

To Know Surprise it was my Landlord
He Notified me I was late with the rent
What Can Ya Do With Your Last Dollar Spent

Ya Got Trouble, Some Kind Of Trouble

I Called UP My Baby for a Little Advice
Because My Sugar Baby Always Treats Me So Nice
I Had A Funny Feeling he wasn't alone
When i Heard another voice whisper ""hang up the phone""

I got Trouble, Some Kind of Trouble

Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble

I Went to my Boss Said I need I Little Time
To Work on This poor Broken Heart of Mine
He Said I'd Like To Help Ya I've Been Their Before but the Problem is Girl
Ya Don't Work here no more

Ya Got Trouble, Some Kind of Trouble

Trouble in My Heart, Trouble on my mind, Never Any Trouble for me to find some kind of Trouble

I Got Trouble

Well I Was Down Around As Low As a Body Can Be
So I Talked to my Preacher about Praying for Me
He Smiled and he said child your not alone
Because all gods children got to deal with their own Trouble

Some Kind Of trouble

Your lips hold a wild desire
And give a kiss like the devil's fire
Your kind of love could burn a town
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

Your touch brings me to my knees
You've got me begging please, please, please
Take my heart and melt it down
Touch me, turn me on and burn me down

You're a wild love I can't tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when you're around
So touch me, turn me on and burn me down

I'm devoured by your fiery flame
My lips can only speak your name
Just spread my ashes all around
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

With soft words I whispered your name
I held your love on the tips of my fingers
But that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I held you right on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right thru my hands
Yes I let you slip right thru my hands

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I held your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let you slip right thru my hands
Yes I let you slip right thru my hands

I held your love on the tips of my fingers...

1580,Reba McEntire,34,Is There Life Out There,1992,"

[Verse 1]
She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready
Now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
But now she's just wondering
What she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

[Chorus]
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering
Is there life out there?

[Verse 2]
She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how
To live for today
She's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy
Or just get away
Something for herself for a change

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then
She looks out the window and wonders again

[Chorus][x2]

The time has come to let you go
My tears will run and they'll keep me afloat
I set you adrift like a burning boat
The time has come to let you go

[Verse]
The time has come to turn you loose
It took my heart this long to face the truth
If i lost you i can lose these blues
The time has come to turn you loose
We had our moment in the sun
But that time has come and now that time is gone
The time has come to set you free
Tonight's the night i'll untie all these dreams
I'll send them away so i can find some piece
The time has come to set you free

1582,Wynonna,36,She Is His Only Need,1992,"

[Verse 1]
Billy was a small town loner who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies but he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder, he knew the way in a small café, found the will

[Verse 2]
He met Miss Bonnie and a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months later the feeling got strong enough
They didn't own a car so it must have been love that drove them uptown
For a diamond, that's when he started going

[Chorus]
Over the line, working overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be
See, it's not for him; she is his only need

[Verse 3]
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder, a new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children and my, how the time did fly

[Verse 4]
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
And then Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray

[Verse 5]
And every once in a while you could see him get up and he'd head downtown
'Cause he heard about something she wanted and it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much, it was love and boy ain't that love just something
When it's strong enough to keep a man going

[Chorus]
Over the line, working overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be
See, it's not for him; she is his only need

[Tag]
Over the line, working overtime, she is his only need
His only need, overboard, over the limit, just for her
She is his only need, his only need [fade out]

1583,Dwight Yoakam,37,The Heart That You Own,1992,"

I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

I pay the rent, pay it right on time
Baby I pay you ever single dime
For my heart, the heart that you own

Used to be I could love here for free
Way back before you bought the property
Now I pay daily on what once was mine
Lord I probably owe you for these tears that I cry

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

I struggle each night to find a new way
To pay what I owe just so I can stay
I ain't overdue so you can't throw me out
I've loved here for years don't know where I'd go now

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart, the heart that you own

Yea, my heart, the heart that you own

1584,Lorrie Morgan,38,Something In Red,1992,"

I'm looking for something in red
Something that's shocking to turn someone's head
Strapless and sequined and cut down to there
Stockings and garters and lace underwear
The guaranteed number to knock the man dead
I'm looking for something in red

I'm looking for something in green
Something to outdo an ex-high school queen
Jealousy comes in the color of jade
Do you have some pumps and a purse in this shade
And a perfume that whispers please come back to me
I'm looking for something in green

I'm looking for something in white
Something that shimmers in soft candlelight
Everyone calls us the most perfect pair
Should I wear a veil or a rose in my hair
Well the train must be long and the waist must be tight
I'm looking for something in white

I'm looking for something in blue
Something real tiny, the baby's brand new
He has his father's nose and his chin
We once were hot lovers now we're more like friends
Don't tell me that just what old married folk do
I'm looking for something in blue

I'm looking for something in red
Like the one that I wore when I first turned his head
Strapless and sequined and cut down to there
Just a size larger than I wore last year
The guaranteed number to knock the man dead
I'm looking for something
I've gotta have something
I'm looking for something in red

[Verse 1:]
I can read the writing on the wall
You pretend that nothing's changed at all
I've got just one thing to ask you if it's so
Just take your memory with you when you go

[Chorus:]
So I won't have to think about
The lonely nights I'll be without
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows
Take your memory with you when you go

[Verse 2:]
I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong
I'll have to find a way to carry on
Why don't you leave before the heartache starts to show
Take your memory with you when you go

[Chorus:]
So I won't have to think about
The lonely nights I'll be without
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows
Take your memory with you
So I won't have to miss you
Take your memory with you when you go

1586,Confederate Railroad,40,She Took It Like A Man,1992,"

I hated like the devil
To tell her we were through
I was sure it would break her heart
Tear her world in two

She is such a fragile thing
Lord, I hate to make her cry
So I broke it to her gently
When I told her goodbye

She cussed me like a sailor
Kicked a hole through the kitchen wall
She threw a fit and threw the phone
Half-way down the hall

She said""I'll be down at the bar""
Then I heard the front door slam
I guess all in all
She took it like a man

I was thinking she'd reach out to me
And beg me not to go
Or run straight to her momma's
'Cause I'd hurt her so

Thought she'd be devastated
I had a tender moment plan
I didn't think that she could take it
But she took it like a man

Raindrops fall from the sky
Teardrops fall from my eyes
Can't stop myself from loving you

Your heartaches found a home
I walk these streets alone
Can't stop myself from loving you

I know I shouldn't waste my time
In dreams of yesterday
But your memory's all that I have left
Since you've gone away

No matter what I do
My heart stays cold and blue
Can't stop myself from loving you

They say that time can heal
A lonley heart that's broke in two
But time ran out on me the day
You walked out of my world

So let the teardrops fall
The rain will hide them all
Can't stop myself from loving you
Can't stop myself from loving you

Two Colt .45's with black plastic grips;
And I'd head west through our neighborhood
And they'd say
'Here comes young Billy and he's up to no good.'
I rode a trail through the neighbor's backyard
Shootin' the Bad Guys through my handlebars
Known for my bravery both far and near
Bein' late for supper was my only fear

I miss Billy the Kid!
The times that he had!
The life that he lived!
I guess he must've got caught
His innocence lost...
I wonder where he is?
I miss Billy the Kid!

These days I don't know whose side to be on;
There's such a thin line between Right and Wrong
I live and learn, do the best I can
But there's only so much you can do as a man

I miss Billy the Kid!
The times that he had!
The life that he lived!
I guess he must've got caught
His innocence lost...
Lord, I wonder where he is?
I miss Billy the Kid!

"
1591,Dan Seals,45,Mason Dixon Line,1992,"

I can hear the distant rumbling
From the unrest in your heart
The dark winds are blowing
Come to tear us apart

Our point of view is different
Depending on which side we're on
And every harsh word echoes
And surely comes back home

Are we separate from each other
Or will we both unite
We come from different places
But love's not black or white
There's something here worth saving
If we reach across in time
We're living on a Mason Dixon Line

We were standing here together
Before the trouble came
Now it circles all around us
Like a moth to a flame
Whoa they say a house divided
In time will surely fall
Will you stand here beside me
With our backs against the wall

Change our hearts
Make us whole
Help us see forever

"
1592,Dennis Robbins,46,Home Sweet Home,1992,
1593,Neal McCoy,47,Where Forever Begins,1992,"

There ain't no hearts
Gettin' one lost
In here tonight
Just the wrong kinda feeling
Gettin' passed around
From left to right

But if a slow dance to a sad song
Is all you need to pretend
Then darling, this is where forever begins

If your looking
For some kinda hero
To catch you
When you fall
Don't surprised if he ain't here call

But if your idea of forever
Is a string of one last dance
Then darling this is where forever begins

No you won't find rainbow ride
To a endless wishing well
Waisted your loving and time
In this be an un-fairytale

But if a slow dance to a sad song
Is all you need to pretend
Then darling, this where forever begins

But if your idea of forever
Is a string of one last dance
Then darling this is where forever begins

1594,Davis Daniel,48,Still Got A Crush On You,1992,
1595,Ricky Skaggs,49,From The Word Love,1992,"

I took my mark for the sounding of the gun
The challenge for your heart had just begun
I never knew I would cross the finish line
I gave it all for the chance to make you mine
From the word love I knew I won the race
From the word love I came out in first place
From the word love my dreams were coming true
All because of you
You cheered me through from the word love
I'm learning what it really means to win
Sometimes I think if I could do it all again
I'd run the race and try for record time
Never looking back just your loving on my mind
From the word love...

"
1596,Lee Roy Parnell,50,What Kind Of Fool Do You Think I Am,1992,"

What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am
Here you come knocking on my door
When you said you don't need me anymore
Now do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwing my good heart after bad love

[Chorus]
What kind of fool do you think I am
I ain't fallin' for you all over again
I ain't playin' a game that I know I can't win
What kind of fool do you think I am
Oh, what kind of fool do you think I am

I was lost in your love and I got burned
You hurt me one time, I finally learned
Now that I know what your lovin' can do
Who do you think you're talkin' to

[Repeat Chorus]

Fallin' in love with you just brought me sorrow
You'll leave me smilin' tonight and cryin' tomorrow

Don't you come knocking on my door
'Cause you know I don't need you anymore
Now do you really think I'm crazy enough
To go throwin' my good heart after bad love

"
1597,John Michael Montgomery,1,I Love The Way You Love Me,1993,"

I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

[Chorus]
But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
An' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

[Chorus]
But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason I could never live without you

[Chorus]
But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

"
1598,Dwight Yoakam,2,Ain't That Lonely Yet,1993,"

You keep callin' me
On the telephone
You say you're all alone
Well that's real sad

And you keep leavin'
Notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more
Girl that's too bad

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

Once there was this
Spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web
Of love and lies

She spun her chains
Around my heart and soul
Never to let go
Oh, but I survived

(Chorus)

There's nothin' left you can do
To try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do
Just brings me down, whoa

(Chorus x4)

"
1599,Wynonna,3,Tell Me Why,1993,"

Everywhere I look the sun is shining
But it's always raining here inside
I can see
You really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love
With a flame that never dies

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Everywhere I go you're in my shadow
When I turn around there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why

Ask anyone you know
And they'll say love fades away
But this hearts' cryin' just like yesterday

And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

So won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

1600,Toby Keith,4,Should've Been A Cowboy,1993,"

[Verse 1]
I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
""Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
Settling down, would you marry me
If I ask you twice and beg you pretty please""
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up, at Kitty's place

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Verse 2]
I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Ranger
Go west young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

[Outro]
Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should have been a cowboy

1601,Larry Stewart,5,Alright Already,1993,"

She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurtin' but what's killin me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory

There I stood with flowers in hand
Hopin' to dry her tears
She walked out that door with him
Grinning from ear to ear

She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurtin' but what's killin me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory

She said there would never be anyone else
No one could fill my shoes
Now she's using that same old line
Snuggled up to someone new

She's alright already, she's back on her feet
It didn't take her long to get over me
My heart's still hurtin' but what's killin me
She's alright already and I'm just a memory

She's alright already and I'm just a memory

1602,Alabama,6,Hometown Honeymoon,1993,"

Hey baby, won't you take my hand
And make me a happy man
I ain't rich but I found my fortune in you
Two jobs on the nighttime shift
I'm still left with an empty fist
But my heart is full and my love is true
We can still get married in the style of our friends and family
Gather all of them to celebrate while we slip out quietly

And have a hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon just me and you
Hometown honeymoon
Get out of church and up to your room
We'll have a hoe-down afternoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

We can sing and laugh out loud
Lifestyles of the poor but proud
Cuddle up on the porch and enjoy the view
We can't afford Niagara Falls
But there's a fountain by the old town hall
We'll make a wish by the light of a lover's moon
I'll get my Grandma's wedding ring
And my brother's Chevrolet
We can stay at your mama's house;
We don't have to go away

To have a hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

Your daddy's prize possession
I'll make a good impression
I'm gonna get his blessing
That's all we need

Hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon just me and you

Hometown Honeymoon
Get out of church and up to your room
We'll have a hoe-down afternoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

Hometown honeymoon

Hometown honeymoon

Hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom...

You've got a thing or two to learn about me baby
'Cause I ain't taking it no more and I don't mean maybe
You don't know right from wrong
Well the love we had is gone
So blame it on your lying, cheating, cold deadbeating
Two-timing, double dealing
Mean mistreating, loving heart

Well all I wanted was to be your one and only
And all I ever got from you was being lonely
Now that dream is laid to rest

1605,Lee Roy Parnell,9,Tender Moment,1993,"

You walked in and found her with tears in her eyes
She couldn't tell you exactly why
There ain't nothing wrong but there ain't nothing right
Try to figure it out boy, you're wasting your time

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

It's a fast lane world that we're living in
Sometimes love takes a little test bend
But it don't take much to straighten it out
A little affection's all I'm talking about

All it takes is a tender moment

A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

Everyday she needs to hear you love her so
So take the time to let her know

It ain't a brand new house, it ain't diamond rings
Big bank accounts don't mean a thing
Still gonna need what money can't buy
Someone to hold her when she needs to cry

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

If I hear her voice

Ever since she was a baby
Sitting on her daddy's knee
Had him wrapped around her finger
Doing anything she pleased

[Verse 2]
She had a way of getting what she wanted
But Daddy knew in his mind
That pretty soon the boys would come running
It's just a matter of time before

Hearts are gonna roll, heads are gonna turn
Tears are gonna fall, a bridge is gonna burn
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll

Never stays in love too long

Leaving behind a path of destruction
No matter where she goes

Hearts are gonna roll, heads are gonna turn
Tears are gonna fall, a bridge is gonna burn
Hearts are gonna roll, hearts are gonna roll

1610,Garth Brooks,14,That Summer,1993,"

[Verse 1]
I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

[Verse 2]
'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

[Chorus]
We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Outro]
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Oh me, oh my, sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no, one else could take her place in my life
Ooo, we had something good
So tell me why she would
Go and make me cry, oh me
Oh my, sweet baby said goodbye

I remember how she'd hold me
And say she'd stay forever true
Back then the future looked so rosey
But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue

Oh me, oh my, sweet baby said goodbye
Oh no, one else could take her place in my life
Ooo, we had something good
So tell me why she would
Go and make me cry, oh me

That she gets from someone new
I only know how much I miss her
And wish she hadn't broke my heart in two

Oh me, oh my, sweet baby said goodbye
'Cause no one else could take her place in my life

I lie here tonight in the darkness
I've never felt so alone
Tomorrow I'll wake up still lonesome
'Cause things haven't changed since you've gone
You walked out with angry words spoken
You're leavin' cut right to the bone
I'll pick up the pieces you have broken
Find the strength to go on

[Chorus:][x2]
I still remember
How my love once held her
How long do old memories last
Why can't I forget it
Why can't I admit it
There ain't no future in the past

[Verse 1]
She knows every move that a man could make
She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give, she knows how to take
But so many times she's been taken a fool

[Chorus]
By those alibis and lying eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you

[Verse 2]
She once thought that love wasn't just a game
Her feelings once came from the heart
One day I gave her a wedding ring
And one night I tore all those feelings apart

[Chorus]
With my alibis and lying eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make

[Chorus]
Her own alibis and lying eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you

1614,John Anderson,18,Money In The Bank,1993,"

It's Friday night, baby, get ready, set, go
Gonna take you to the Krystal and a picture show
Well, the sky's the limit, there's no price too high
Baby, you're the apple of my eye
Got my paycheck in my pocket and some gas in the tank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank

I wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28
But I guess that stuff'll have to wait
'Cause I'm saving on a washer and a wedding ring
I want this love to be a lasting thing
Right at the top, that's where you rank:
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank

Oh, oh, you make me feel like a million bucks
Oh, oh, I oughta drive you around in an armored truck

Late last night, I had a crazy dream
I met a man who invented a money machine
He said: ""I know things are tight and times are tough,""
But he'd give me the machine if I'd give you up
I just looked him in the eye and I said: ""No thanks.""
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank
Honey, your love's better than money in the bank

1615,McBride & The Ride,19,Love On The Loose  Heart On The Run,1993,"

1.So many men have held her hand

Only one held her attention
He put her pride on a downhill slide

Faster than she cares to mention

Her feelings are all out of focus

Nothing is clear anymore

Her heart's playing hocus pocus

Trying to even the score

C.So think what you want, do what you may

You're just a game that she's got to play

Like a fast movin' train or a slow settin' sun

She's a love on the loose with a heart on the run

Love on the loose with a heart on the run

.There's a pain in her heart where love used to be
He cut her loose now she's fancy free
She makes the rules now when she plays the game
She thinks it's better that way
Now when you see her she lights up the night
With neon eyes sparkling bright
Her heart is something that you'll never win
But that don't mean you can't try

They say that there's a hole in the atmosphere
The things you think will last disappear
When you were ready to say I do
Somebody lowered the boom on you
Now you need a sympathetic ear

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it

Love isn't always true it hurts sometimes
Your tears will tell on you girl, I'm not blind
I know what you're goin' through
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it

You took a lesson in playin' a fool
I graduated from that school too
If you need a shoulder cry on mine

Tell me about it
Tell me about teardrops in the dark
Tell me about it
Tell me about your broken heart
You say you need someone to hold you tight
(You) can't stand another lonely night
Well come closer and
Tell me about it

1617,Randy Travis,21,An Old Pair Of Shoes,1993,"

I've walked a million miles across this floor
But I never have quite made it to the door
I never thought the time would come
I'd ever see this day
You could make me feel so thrown away
I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes
All worn out from walking through these blues
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm really feeling used
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
You've always been my one and only love
It ain't no easy thing to give you up
Looking back I'm feeling like
There's nothing left to lose
This time I may just walk out on you
'Cause I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes
All worn out from walking through these blues
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm really feeling used
I'm just like an old pair of shoes
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm really feeling used
I'm just like an old pair of shoes

"
1618,Collin Raye,22,Somebody Else's Moon,1993,"

I look out my window at the world I once owned
And I see it's still spinning round
But somewhere above me a light I once knew
No longer shines through the clouds

But that's somebody else's moon tonight
Those are somebody else's stars
They're are no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms

Remember the wishes we made in the night
When dreams were supposed to come true
Well I do 'cause you put the stars in my eyes
As you softly promised the moon

That's somebody else's moon tonight
Those are somebody else's stars
They're are no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms

They're no longer mine
'Cause somewhere tonight
You're in somebody else's arms

1619,Suzy Bogguss,23,Heartache,1993,"

I'm here out of love and I wish I could stay
But I know you heartache you'll stand in my way
There's no use in wishin' 'cause I ain't satisfied
I'm fit to be a misfit when you're at my side

Heartache find another place to be
I'm tired of being your best friend
Look to another for your companion
And when you do my pain will end

There's nowhere at all I'm feeling no pain
My body is sickly and my mind is insane
I call on you heartache to come show me how
I can't get no lower than this hole I'm in now

Heartache find another place to be
I'm tired of being your best friend
Look to another for your companion
And when you do my pain will end

Heartache find another place to be
I'm tired of being your best friend
Look to another for your companion
And when you do my pain will end

When you do my pain will end...

[Verse 1]
I know you can make it in this world on your own
But I wanna take care of you
The woman within may think that it's wrong
But I wanna take care of you

[Chorus]
I'll show you the love of a man that knows how
To hold you without holding you down
It's not a sign of weakness if you'll let me be strong
I wanna take care of you

I wanna take care of you
In the prime of our years and until time ticks us older
I wanna take care of you

I'll be your hope when the water's too deep
And I'll share my blanket when trouble winds turn colder
I wanna take care of you

'Cause I've got nothing to prove but the way I feel
It's love but it's so much more
And for once in my life I know what I am living for

So I can take care of you
Yeah when the good Lord takes you, well He better take me too
So I can take care of you

It's all I wanna do, is take care of you

1621,Sammy Kershaw,25,She Don't Know She's Beautiful,1993,"

[Verse 1]
We go out to a party somewhere
The moment we walk in the door
People stop and everybody stares
She don't know what they're staring for

[Chorus]
She don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (no, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

[Verse 2]
There she goes just walking down the street
And someone lets a whistle out
A girl like her she just can't see
What the fuss is all about

And she don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (no, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her so

Morning comes and her hair's all a mess
That's when she thinks she looks her worst
It's times like this she don't know why
I can't take my eyes off her

She don't know she's beautiful (no, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful
Though time and time I've told her

She don't know she's beautiful (never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful (no, she's not that kind)
She don't know she's beautiful

1622,Mary Chapin Carpenter,26,The Hard Way,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show that things that drew me to you an' stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Our hearts are beating while we sleep
But while we're wide awake

And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
And what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

[Verse 2]
Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when
And the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us
When fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling
Not by luck, but by never turnin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
Some will call on destiny
But I just call on faith

[Chorus]
That the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
To what your heart might say

Caught up in our little lives
There's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that field of clover

So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given
And the other one we make

And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Because the world won't stop
Hang on, baby

1623,Clint Black With Wynonna,27,A Bad Goodbye,1993,"

I've been bound to leave you, we've known that for a while
I'm sure it's something I can't do
If I can't leave you with a smile
I don't know how far I'll have to go
'Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry
And in my mind I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye
There's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

I'm still bound to leave you, I surely don't know how
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind said should happen now
I don't know where we'll go from here
There may be no way to fly
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all too clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye
There's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try
And any way I look I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

"
1624,Ricky Van Shelton,28,Just As I Am,1993,"

I was lost and aimlessly searching
Lord knows, I was one lonely man
Then you came along
Like that old gospel song
You took me just as I am

Just as I was about to lose hope
Just as I'd come to the end of my rope
You turned me around with one touch of your hand
And your love saved me just as I am

It's amazing, you saw the light shining
Though the darkness that life had left me in
And I thank heaven above
You took me just as I was
And you loved me just as I am

Just as I was about to lose hope
Just as I'd come to the end of my rope
You turned me around with one touch of your hand
And your love saved me just as I am
You turned me around with one touch of your hand
And your love saved me just as I am

[Verse  1-George Strait]
When did you stop loving me?
How long have I been a memory?
I've got to know for my own sanity
Tell me when did you stop loving me?

[Verse  2-George Strait]
Was it that night that you stayed out until dawn?
You know that night has haunted me for so long
Or was your love already cold?
Tell me please I got to know
Darling when did you stop loving me?

[Verse  3-George Strait]
There was a time when you worshipped where I stood
Heaven knows I'd bring it back if I could
Now I can tell when we make love
It ain't me you're thinking of
Tell me when did you stop loving me?
Darling, when did you stop loving me?

1626,Lorrie Morgan,30,I Guess You Had To Be There,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Hello honey, how was your day
Well you're sure in a good mood tonight
Oh by the way, I was downtown this afternoon
And I saw the most amazing sight

[Verse 2]
Through the window of a small café
I saw a man and a woman holding hands
And they looked so in love, it took my breath away
Can't you see it, don't you understand

[Chorus]
Well I guess you had to be there
You really had to be there
Some things you just can't explain
It's just not the same
I guess you had to be there

[Verse 3]
I just stood there, my heart pounding
I couldn't move, all I could do was stare
I kept remembering when we used to look like that
Two people with so much to share

[Verse 4]
They were talking and they were laughing
Just like we used to do every day
And then he kissed her so tenderly
What's the matter, you don't have much to say

[Chorus]
Well I guess you had to be there
You really had to be there
Some things you just can't explain
It's just not the same
I guess you had to be there

[Verse 5]
And as I watched you with your new love
I haven't see you that happy in years
We've drifted so far apart and it's hard to admit it
But there's nothing left for you here

[Chorus]
So I guess you had to be there
You really had to be there
Some things you just can't explain
It's just not the same
I guess you had to be there

I guess you had to be there

1627,Robert Ellis Orrall,31,A Little Bit Of Her Love,1993,"

One little kiss
And then I'll miss her
All day long
She's all I talk about
My baby's smile
I'd walk a mile
For every one
I know without a doubt
I can't live without

A little bit of her love
Gets me through the day
A little bit of her love
Goes a long long way
When the whole world's
Falling down around me
She can lift me up
(With a bit of her love)
With a little bit of her love
A little bit of her love

I know that I
Would rather die
Than be apart
She means that much to me
One tiny hug
And then she's tuggin'
At my heart
That's all I really need
You better believe

A little bit of her love
Gets me through the day
A little bit of her love
Goes a long long way
When the whole world's
Falling down around me
She can lift me up
(With a bit of her love)
With a little bit of her love
A little bit of her love

1628,Alan Jackson,32,Tonight I Climbed The Wall,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Our room was filled with silence
I guess we'd said it all
I don't know when I'd seen our bedroom
So long I can't recall
We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall

[Chorus]
Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall

[Verse 2]
Making love is so much sweeter
When you love the one you hold
After all these years of holding her
You'd think by now I'd know
Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Because tonight I climbed the wall

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Tonight I climbed the wall [x2]

1629,Pam Tillis,33,Cleopatra  Queen Of Denial,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Well I said he had a lot of potential
He was only misunderstood
You know, he really didn't mean to treat me so bad
He wanted to be good
And I swore one day I would tame him
Even though he loved to run hog wild
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

[Verse 2]
I knew he didn't have any money
Yeah, that's why he couldn't buy me a ring
Oh and just because he bought himself a brand new pick-up truck
Really didn't prove anything
And he never had to say he loved me
I could see it every time he smiled
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

[Chorus]
Oh Queen of Denial
Buying all his alibis
Queen of Denial
Floating down a river of lies, yeahhh

[Verse 3]
Well I'm not gonna jump to conclusions
Or throw away this perfect romance
Even though I saw him dancing last night
With a girl in leopard skin pants
Oh he's probably stuck in traffic
And he'll be here in a little while
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

[Chorus]
Oh Queen of Denial
Buying all his alibis
Queen of Denial
Just floating down a river of lies, oh yeahhh

1630,Aaron Tippin,34,My Blue Angel,1993,"

Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
Surrounded by strangers, she don't know the dangers
One drink could lead her to
And if she falls, it's all my fault
For doin' a good woman wrong
I can't be far behind her
Oh, Lord, help me find her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight

Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far

Now I'm not so sure how long her tears
Could last in a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at anytime
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose
That precious angel of mine

Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight

Yes, tell her heaven without her feels like hell tonight

1631,Radney Foster,35,Nobody Wins,1993,"

[Verse 1]
You said this ain't over yet
I said things that I'll regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal
Before another bitter word gets used
I was hoping we could call a truce

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wins. we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins

[Verse 2]
Darlin' we got too much pride
It don't matter who's wrong or right
Honey love ain't black and white
The way I feel 'bout you
All I want to do is hold you tight
I can't take another angry night

[Chorus]
When nobody wins. we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins

[Bridge]
I know something's 'bout to break
If we don't bend
Baby, what's it gonna take?

[Chorus]
Nobody wins. we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse again and again
Nobody wins, slamming doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play this game no more
'Cause nobody wins
Nobody wins, nobody wins

1632,Confederate Railroad,36,When You Leave That Way You Can Never Go Back,1993,"

I remember waking in the morning
To the sound of a rooster's crow
Mama cooking in the kitchen
And Arthur Godfrey on the radio

Me and dad were just like strangers
We never did see eye to eye
It came to blows one Sunday morning
So I packed my bags and I said goodbye

And when you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Some times I wish I'd never roamed, oh no
Cause when you leave that way you can never go home

Then I met a girl in Knoxville
Oh we set our wedding date
Left her standing at the altar
With a baby on the way...

And when you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Some times I wish I'd never roamed, oh no
Cause when you leave that way you can never go home

Lord I'd love to see my Mom and Daddy
And what I'd give to hold that boy of mine
I'd get down on my knees and say I'm sorry
If I could only go back one more time
But I killed a man in Houston
When he caught me with his wife
And I told the preacher man to leave me alone
When he came to read my rights
And he said son

When you leave that way you can never come back
A soul won't roll on a torn up track
All through eternity you'll roam alone
Cause when you leave that way you can never come home
All through eternity you'll roam alone
Cause when you leave that way you can never come home

1633,Reba McEntire & Vince Gill,37,The Heart Won't Lie,1993,"

[Verse 1: Reba McEntire]
Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

[Pre-Chorus: Reba McEntire]
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus: Both & Reba McEntire]
Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

[Verse 2: Vince Gill]
Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

[Pre-Chorus: Vince Gill]
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus: Both, Vince Gill, & Reba McEntire]
Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lie

[Verse 1]
It's your call, it's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hanging on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it, don't act so surprised
It's time to end this game you're playing
She's not the only one who's waiting on the line

It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye

[Chorus]
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night
Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, it's your call

[Verse 2]
There's no easy way out this time
Because I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

[Chorus]

1635,Mark Collie,39,Born To Love You,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Some people go through life
Never knowing why they're here
They never find someone like you
The moment I touched your hand
And looked into your eyes
I knew what I was meant to do

[Chorus]
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm holding you
It feels just like a dream
And fear cuts through me like a knife
If I should wake up what would I do
If you weren't lying by my side

[Chorus]
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die
Girl I was born to love you, I was born to love you
I was born to love you, 'til the day I die

1636,Brooks & Dunn,40,We'll Burn That Bridge,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Hello Miss Heartbroke
Sit your sweet self down
It's good to see your dancin' feet back out on the town
Rumour has it you've had trouble with your man
I've had trouble of my own, I think I understand

[Chorus]
We'll put out your old flame
We'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down and take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around
And you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there

[Verse 2]
Come on let your hair down we'll have us a time
He had his chance with you now all I want is mine
Give me half an hour or just a dance or two
And you'll forget old what's his name and how he walked out on you

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
We'll burn that bridge when we get there
Burn it down baby

1637,Clint Black,41,When My Ship Comes In,1993,"

No sun on the Rockies, not even the light of day
I feel that old cabin fever coming on
But I know where I'll be when lady luck finally blows my way
She'll put the wind in my sails and I'll be gone
It won't be long before my ship comes in

Gonna sail right out of Colorado
Catch a ride on a warm trade wind to Puerta
No-One-Knows
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
Gonna board and go whichever way the wind blows
I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta
No-One-Knows When my ship comes in
Maybe I'm only dreaming but it sure seems real
Somehow the wind doesn't chill quite to the bone
Or could it just be the fever I'm running on an uneven keel
Not losing sight of why I'm up here alone

Chorus

It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
It won't be long before my ship comes in
She'll find me waiting when my ship comes in
When my ship comes in

1638,Ricky Lynn Gregg,42,If I Had A Cheatin' Heart,1993,
1639,Brooks & Dunn,43,Hard Workin' Man,1993,"

[Verse 1]
I'm a hard working man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm getting really good at barely getting by
Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue collar roots
I feel like I'm working overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

[Chorus]
I'm a hard, hard working man
I got it all on the line
For a peace of the promised land
I'm burning my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire going
Is to outrun the wind

[Verse 2]
Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday morning I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothing but business from nine till five

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I can't wait to get up in the morning
And do it all over again
Well I'm a hard living, hard working man

But it
Ain't so bad

You won't ever have to be alone again
I will allways love you
Till the very end

Hey baby
Don't be blue
I will allways
Take care of you

Break

You won't ever have to be alone again
I will allways love you
Till the very end

Hey Baby
Don't you cry
I'm gonna wipe those little
Teardrops dry

1641,Gibson Miller Band,45,High Rollin',1993,"

[Verse 1]
Played a game with the Queen of Hearts
She had a way of holding cards
That she wasn't showing
When the game wasn't going her way

[Verse 2]
Joker's wild and so was I
I should've seen through her poker smile
I would've had to cheat her
To beat her at her own game

[Chorus]
I've got holes in my pride and holes in my pocket
And a big ole hole in my heart where she broke it
Call me a loser, but I'm just a gambling man
I may be down on my love, down on my money
But I'll be back in the game soon honey
High rolling, holding the winning hand

[Verse 3]
She rolled my heart like she rolled the dice
Threw me once, she threw me twice
I thought luck was a lady
But the lady was a rolling stone

[Verse 4]
Now I'm at home, playing Solitaire
Nobody ever said that love was fair
But the queen of hearts is a card
You should leave alone

[Chorus]
I've got holes in my pride and holes in my pocket
And a big ole hole in my heart where she broke it
Call me a loser, but I'm just a gambling man
I may be down on my love, down on my money
But I'll be back in the game soon honey
High rolling, holding the winning hand

[Chorus]
I've got holes in my pride and holes in my pocket
And a big ole hole in my heart where she broke it
Call me a loser, but I'm just a gambling man
I may be down on my love, down on my money
But I'll be back in the game soon honey
High rolling, holding the winning hand

[Tag]
High rolling, holding the winning hand
High rolling, high rolling
Oooh

1642,Tanya Tucker,46,It's A Little Too Late,1993,"

Well, I was up all night well wonderin' what to do
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you
But it's a little too late;
Well, it's a little too late
When you walked in I shoulda walked out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Well, the whole town told me you're a heart break king;
Guess I oughta pay attention when they say those things
Well, it's a little too late
Well, it's a little too late
I know all my old buddies wanna help me out
But it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Turn the jukebox up throw some sawdust down
I'm too far gone to turn this heart around
I may be wrong but I don't walk out;
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Turn the jukebox up an' throw some sawdust down
I'm too far gone to turn this heart around
I may be wrong but I don't walk out;
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

I was up all night well wonderin' what to do
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you
But it's a little too late;
Well, it's a little too late
When you walked in I shoulda walked out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

I may be wrong but I don't walk out
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now

"
1643,Garth Brooks,47,Learning To Live Again,1993,"

[Verse 1]
I burned my hand, an' I cut my face
Heaven knows how long it's been
Since I've felt, so out of place
I'm wonderin' if I'll fit in
Debbie and Charlie, said they'd be here by nine
And Deb said she might bring a friend
Just my luck, they're right on time
So here I go again

[Chorus]
An' I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's goin' out of style
Look into her eyes and pray, that she don't see
That learning to live again, is killin' me

[Verse 2]
A little cafe, a table for four
But there's just conversation for three
I like the way she let me get the door
And I wonder what she thinks of me
Debbie just whispered, ""You're doin' fine""
And I wish that I felt the same
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine
Oh, my God, I've forgotten her name

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna smile my best smile
And I'm gonna laugh like it's goin' out of style
Look into her eyes and pray, that she don't see
This learning to live again, is killin' me

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now here we are, beneath her porch light
And I say what a great time it's been
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper goodnight
And I say, ""Can I see you again""
And she just smiles her best smile
And she laughs like it's goin' out of style
Looks into my eyes and says, ""We'll see""

[Outro]
Oh this learning to live again, is killin' me
God, this learning to live again, is killin' me

"
1644,Sammy Kershaw,48,Haunted Heart,1993,"

[Verse 1]
Go down the road called Yesterday
Take a left on a Lost Highway
And make a right on Memory Lane
Drive until you feel the pain

[Verse 2]
And at the River of Tears, take one last turn
And cross the bridge that just won't burn
A run-down house is love's graveyard
That's where you'll find my haunted heart

[Chorus]
Well my haunted heart can't rest in peace
It's buried with her memory
And it's a living hell here after dark
All alone with a haunted heart

[Verse 3]
Late at night, a slamming door
Shadows move across the floor
Footsteps fall on silent stairs
I hear her call but no one's there

[Verse 4]
Her photograph hangs by the bed
A grim reminder love is dead
A love I killed just won't depart
It's living in my haunted heart

[Chorus]
Well my haunted heart can't rest in peace
It's buried with her memory
And it's a living hell here after dark
All alone with a haunted heart

[Tag]
I said I'm all alone with a haunted heart

"
1645,Billy Ray Cyrus,49,She's Not Cryin' Anymore,1993,"

[Verse 1]
She used to cry when I'd come home late
She couldn't buy the lies I told
All she wanted was to be needed
Someone that she could call her own
Her love, I know I took for granted
Until she walked out of my door
Too little too late to say I'm sorry
'Cause she's not crying anymore

[Chorus]
She's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore

[Verse 2]
I guess she's really doing well
Now she's picked herself up off the ground
I wasn't there when I was needed
But I was there to let her down
Sometimes, you know, I feel so foolish
If I knew then what I know now
Another tear would never fall
'Cause I'd give our love my all
If we could work things out somehow

[Chorus]
But she's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore

[Chorus]
She's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore

"
1646,Trisha Yearwood,50,You Say You Will,1993,"

You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing, then do something else
And even though I know that all too well

I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do

Love doesn't come with any guarantees
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
You give me back a stack of I.O.U's

There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere

You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do

Mmm, I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do

You say you will
You say you will, you make it sound so sweet
You say you will
But you never....do

1647,Tim McGraw,1,Don't Take The Girl,1994,"

[Verse 1]
Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

[Outro]
Johnny's daddy
Was takin' him fishin'

1648,Toby Keith,2,Wish I Didn't Know Now,1994,"

[Verse 1]
I never ask you where you are going
I never ask you where you have been
I have never called and checked your story
When you stayed out with all your friend's
I have never tried to catch you lying
I did not want to know the truth
I would rather go on loving blind girl
Than go on loving without you

[Chorus]
I wish I did not know now what I did not know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I am not saying it is you
You could never be true
I just do not want to know how it ends
You would still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I would still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then

[Verse 2]
I have always said what I do not know
Could not hurt as bad as leaving you
Turns out I knew what I was thinking
It is not an easy thing to do
Well I guess I should be going
I sure found out too much to stay
Please do not say you are sorry
I might wait another day

[Chorus]
I wish I did not know now what I did not know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I am not saying it is you
You could never be true
I just do not want to know how it ends
You would still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I would still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then

[Outro]
You would still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I would still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then
Yeah, I wish somehow I did not know now what I did not know then

1649,John Berry,3,Your Love Amazes Me,1994,"

I've seen the seven wonders of the world
I've seen the beauty of diamonds and pearls
But they ain't nothin baby
Your love amazes me

I've seen a sunset that would make you cry
And colors of a rainbow reachin cross the sky
The moon in all its phases, but
Your love amazes me

(Chorus)
Don't you ever doubt this love of mine
You're the only one for me
You give me hope, you give me reason
You give me somethin to believe in
Forever faithfully
Your love amazes me

I've prayed for miracles that never came
Got down on my knees out in the pourin rain
But only you could save me
Your love amazes me

(Repeat Chorus)

"
1650,John Michael Montgomery,4,Rope The Moon,1994,"

I don't have a lot to show
For these years of hard work
If you look at what I own
Still she's always telling me
To hold on to my dreams
Even when my hope is gone
Some may say that dreaming's just for fools
And there are times I thought that might be true

But she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon

When I look at the sky
But can't see through the clouds
She shows me the brightest stars
If I think of coming back
Cause I'm having my doubts
She tells me I've come so far
Nothing in this world comes easily
But I can't lose with her right next to me

Cause she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon
Oh she thinks I could rope the moon

1651,Patty Loveless,5,How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,1994,"

Through the back window of our '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try how can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase
I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
She said how can I help you...

Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now my time here is over
And with her final words she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly...

1652,Randy Travis,6,Before You Kill Us All,1994,"

Must be doin' something wrong baby I don't know
But the gold fish are floating at the top of the bowl
And the dog he won't eat he just lays around
All night long he makes a lonesome sound
I know I had it coming
And its all my fault
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
The way the plants are dyin' you'd swear its fall
Looks just like autumn up and down the hall
And I talk to them baby like you supposed to do
But they're tired of hearing how I'm missin' you
And I know you told me
Not to call
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
Well its a desperate situation
I got a strong will to survive
But if this place is any indication
I may not make it out on time
Well its an eerie feeling in the still of the night
Knowin' that the cats down to three more lives
You've turned us all into nervous wrecks
We just sit around and wanderin' who's goin' to be next
And I know I had it coming
And its all my fault
But baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Baby come back
Before you kill us all
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back

1653,Brooks & Dunn,7,That Ain't No Way To Go,1994,"

[Verse 1]
Lipstick letter 'cross the mirror this mornin'
Said, ""Goodbye, baby,"" you left without warnin'
Like a thief in the night, you ran away with my heart
I can't believe my eyes, must be a bad dream
You always said we had a good thing
You never once let on we were fallin' apart

[Chorus]
That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go

[Verse 2]
Gettin' nowhere, I'm tired of thinkin'
Guess I'll do a little wishful dreamin'
And make a whiskey wish upon a star
Train whistle blowin' down the track
Lonesome sound says she ain't comin' back
It's such a cold blow from out of the dark

[Chorus]
That ain't no way to go, girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time...

[Outro]
That ain't no way to go, now girl, it just ain't right
Don't you think that I deserve to hear you say goodbye
That ain't no way to go, now was it all a lie
After all this time, that ain't no way to go

1654,George Strait,8,Lovebug,1994,"

[Verse 1]
Well I was ruling the roost, had all the chicks to myself
And suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt
Well I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me
Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?

[Chorus]
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug

[Verse 2]
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style
But I lost that race by a good old country mile
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise

[Chorus 2x]

[Outro]
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the love bug

1655,Vince Gill,9,Whenever You Come Around,1994,"

The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

[Chorus:]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I feel so helpless, I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

[Chorus]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile theat smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

And when you smile that smile
The  world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
Whenever you come around

1656,Kathy Mattea,10,Walking Away A Winner,1994,"

Any time love is on the table the stakes are high
But I thought this was love so I laid it all on the line
You nearly took everything I had
Never knew I could hurt so bad
But I least I left with every pieace of this heart of mine

(Chorus)
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know I'll be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life

It was a hard way to go when I didn't know when to leave
If you knew all along baby you weren't telling me
Now I know I could live or die
Im heading down the right road now
Still believeing in a way
That a real love is meant to be

(Chorus)
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know I'll be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life

Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know I'll be alright

Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
Walking away a winner

1657,Clay Walker,11,Where Do I Fit In The Picture,1994,"

Well, it looks like you finally made the front page
You always did look good in white
And I hope you like the ring of your new name
The one you'll be given tonight

But all of this is news to me
I wondered why you never called
I guess that's the way that it's meant to be
If you're gonna ride you've gotta learn to fall

But, where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall

Well, it looks like I finally made the front page
You know you always said I would
And things are well here in room 28
God I hope you're doin' good

There's a picture in my wallet that I look at sometimes
It sends chills through my bones
For long lost love or whatever you wanna call it
Whoa, but it left me all alone

Where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
On an old forgotten wall

1658,Neal McCoy,12,Wink,1994,"

I woke up this morning
My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin' to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink

[Chorus]
Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of sayin' she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin'
And I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

[Chorus]
Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

In this complicated world
It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure
Push to the limit
I'm standin' at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

[Chorus]
Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

1659,Pam Tillis,13,Spilled Perfume,1994,"

I ain't even gonna ask you
I can read you like a book
Girl, if I ever saw one that's an
I can't believe I did that look
You look like something
That the cat drug in
So I won't kick you while you're down
Just let me tell you, friend to friend
About a block I've been around

Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume

There's a big difference
Between lonely and
Lonely for way too long
And I knew when he made his move
You weren't feeling all that strong
So I bit my tongue
Cuz I saw it coming
She danced so close to him
It's two steps forward and three steps back
When a heart is on the mend

Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume

You fell in a moment of weakness
When, you've just gotta
Pull yourself back up
Dry your morning-after tears
Cuz what's done is done

Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume

No use crying over
No use crying over
No use crying over spilled perfume

1660,Clint Black,14,A Good Run Of Bad Luck,1994,"

A high roller even when the chips are down
To win her over, I'd seen the tables turn around
She's ten the hard way, I can feel it in my bones
She'll be makin' my day and not another night alone
'Til it's time for a windfall and not a single minute too soon
I've been too long overdue, now I'm gonna shoot the moon

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

I've been to the table, and I've lost it all before
I'm willin' and able, always comin' back for more
Squeezin' out a thin dime 'til there's no one hanging on my arm
I've gambled on a third time, a fool will tell you it's a charm
If I'm bettin' on a loser, I'm gonna have a devil to pay
But it's the only game I know to play, it doesn't matter anyway

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

1661,Collin Raye,15,Little Rock,1994,"

Well, I know I disappeared a time or two
And along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
Selling VCR's in Arkansas at a Wal-Mart

I haven't had a drink in nineteen days
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
That Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

Lying here upon this motel bed
My thoughts of you explode inside my head
Like a castle built upon the sand
I let love crumble in my hand

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me

Without you, baby I'm not me...

I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock

"
1662,Reba McEntire,16,Why Haven't I Heard From You,1994,"

[Verse 1]
Back in 1876 an old boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

[Chorus]
So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

[Verse 2]
Well there's no problem getting to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding and call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man he told me that my phone is working fine
And I've come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

[Chorus]
So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

[Bridge]
There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And a thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothing about

[Chorus]
So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

1663,Confederate Railroad,17,Daddy Never Was The Cadillac Kind,1994,"

We were poor when I was a young'un
I don't remember ever going hungry
Daddy made sure we didn't do without
I went to school with some of these fellas
They had money and I was jealous
I didn't know then what I know now
Daddy'd say you can't judge a book by looking at its cover
It's what's inside that really matters

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

I left home right out of high school
Bought me a big car thought I was real cool
Cruisin' around the old neighborhood
I'd see Dad after church on Sunday
I'd say you'll have to go riding with me someday
He just said no, I never understood
He asked me how I bought it, I told him on credit
Daddy just smiled, I'll never forget it

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

It took a while but now I'm grown
I've settled down with kids of my own
The more I give them
The more they want

Daddy left us last November
I don't remember him ever looking better
All laid out in his Sunday best
I'm sure instead of all the attention
All he'd of wanted was a few words mentioned
A simple man simply laid to rest
As they drove him away in that big Cadillac
With a tear in my eye I had to laugh

Daddy never was the Cadillac kind
He said some things just glitter and shine
He taught us that love was the one thing money couldn't buy
Daddy never was the Cadillac kind

1664,Boy Howdy,18,They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore,1994,
1665,Joe Diffie,19,In My Own Backyard,1994,"

I thought that life was runnin' off
Leavin' me behind
So like a fool I jumped the fence
Just to see what I could find
But love kept disappearing like
Children chasing fire flies in the dark
And to think that I once had it all
In my own backyard

You'd never know it now, but I used to have it all
A swing set and a plastic pool, a shaggy dog that lived to fetch a ball
An angel with a glass of tea, laughin' at the kids and me
All soakin' wet from washin' that old car
And to think that I once had it all, in my own backyard

That bare spot's grown over now
Where third base used to be
And the weeds have choked out all the flowers
But they can't kill the memories
Lord, I'd love to run back home
But there's no one there for me
And that grass I used to hate to mow
Sure is lookin' green

Ohh, you'd never know it now, but I used to have it all
A swing set and a plastic pool, a shaggy dog that lived to fetch a ball
An angel with a glass of tea, laughin' at the kids and me
All soakin' wet from washin' that old car
And to think that I once had it all, in my own backyard

You'd never know it now, but I used to have it all,all, all
[Spoken]
Once I had everything

In my own back yard.....

1666,Shenandoah,20,If Bubba Can Dance (I Can Too),1994,"

[Verse 1]
Well, he saw it on TV and ordered that video
He learned every step at home and never told a soul
When I saw him out there the very first time, I knew
Well, if Bubba can dance, well, I can too

[Chorus]
Well, if Bubba can scoot, Bubba can slide
Bubba can two-step and Bubba can glide
I never thought he had the nerve, he never said a word
Well, everybody in the place stand back
And give me some room cause if Bubba can dance, I can too

[Verse 2]
Now I've been watchin' all night and I'm workin' my courage up
Hey that dudes on the floor and he's doin' all the latest stuff
Well, if he's brave enough then I know what I've gotta do
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too
Well, if Bubba can dance, I can too

1667,Alabama,21,The Cheap Seats,1994,"

This town ain't big, this town ain't small
It's a little of both they say
Our ball club may be minor league but at least it's triple A
We sit below the Marlboro man, above the right field wall
We do the wave all by ourself
Hey ump, a blind man could've made that call

We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it
We don't worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats

The game was close, we'll call it a win
Go off to toast the boys again
That local band is back in town
They got a kinda minor league sound
They're not that bad, they're not that good
But all in all it's understood
We wanna dance, they wanna play
We wouldn't have it any other way

We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it
We don't worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats

Cheap seats

Now the majors called up ol' what's his name
And one more buildin' rises tall
And suddenly we're all grown up
And this old town not quite so small
But I'll always miss the middle size town
In the middle of the middle-west
With no name pitchers and local bands
And mustard and relish and all the rest

We like our beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it
We don't worry about the pennant much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats

Cheap seats

1668,Mark Chesnutt,22,Woman  Sensuous Woman,1994,"

Woman, sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
Woman, sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again
Step by step you taught me easy lovin'
Night by night you caught me in your web
My self control was overruled by passion
Now, I couldn't see the heartache up ahead
So, woman, sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
I say woman, sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again
Someone true is waiting and I should be with her
And she don't know I crave your ecstasy
But many hearts will break if I don't conquer
This lustful spell you've cast over me
So, woman, sensuous woman
You control the world I'm living in
Woman, sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again
Release my body and let me live again

"
1669,Mary Chapin Carpenter,23,I Take My Chances,1994,"

[Verse 1]
I took a walk in the rain one day
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I cannot disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

[Chorus 1]
I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

[Verse 2]
I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette

[Chorus 2]
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

[Verse 3]
I've crossed lines with words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side

[Chorus 3]
I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

[Chorus 4]
I take my chances
Yeah, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

[Outro]
I'll take my chances
I'll take my chances

1670,Travis Tritt,24,Foolish Pride,1994,"

[Verse 1]
She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow
And fought off the urge to just break down and call
Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
But now who's to blame don't matter much at all
She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness
So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried
Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride

[Verse 2]
He relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks the floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead he cries, 'I'll be damned if I'll crawl'
If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

[Chorus]
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride

{Outro]
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

1671,BlackHawk,25,Every Once In A While,1994,"

When the moon is bright
On a Saturday night
There's a thousand stars in the sky
On a winding road her memory flows
She'll face the fact
She wants to go back

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while
Every once in a while""

She tries to forget
But she hasn't yet
Not a single day goes by
That feeling again reminds of when
I held her tight, it felt so right

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while
Every once in a while""

And every once in a while
She calls my name out loud
And when she thinks about us
She'll face the fact
She wants to go back

She opens her heart to an old memory
She closes her eyes and she smiles
Just ask her if she ever still
Thinks about me
She'll say ""Every once in a while
Every once in a while""
""Every once in a while""
""Every once in a while""

1672,Doug Stone,26,Addicted To A Dollar,1994,"

Eighty hours a week, that's what I call work
And this black under my blue collar is his best pay dirt
They work me hard from dawn to dusk
Doin' double time puttin' out sweat for a filthy buck

F.I.C.A. and the state
They make my paycheck look like a big mistake
Tax man takes his before I see a cent
And what they don't get, I've already spent

Chorus
I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime
I pick up my paycheck and pass it on down the line
The more money that I'm making, the less I can call mine
Well, I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime

Got me more payments than I've got checks
Ten more to go on this car, it's a wreck
Landlord's at my door, it's a life of hard knocks
When all I really want is my piece of the rock

Repeat Chorus

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
And didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can?
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

[Verse 2]
You're out on the street looking good
Baby, deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
No, you'll never hear me crying
You know I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singing once again
So come on, come on, come on

Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
Break it

Why don't you just take it?
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
And you'll break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Why don't you take...
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
And you'll break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart

It Won't Be Over You
Steve Wariner
Drive

When she told me it was over
My tears fell like rain to the ground
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
I may have gone under but I did not drown

I can't say that my last tear's fallen
I may cry another time or two
There's still a chance that I'll get my heart broken
But the next time I do it won't be over you

Well the sun is shining brighter
With each mile that slips beneath my wheels
And the load is getting lighter
Now I know how freedom feels

I can't say that my last tear's fallen
I may cry another time or two
There's still a chance that I'll get my heart broken
But the next time I do it won't be over you

There's a sun on the horizon
That outshines all the pain you put me through

I can't say that my last tear's fallen
I may cry another time or two
There's still a chance that I'll get my heart broken
But the next time I do it won't be over you

I can't say that my last tear's fallen
I may cry another time or two
There's still a chance that I'll get my heart broken
But the next time I do it won't be over you

I talk to people who aren't there
To get through one night a day

Sing along with the ones I know

But they're all just a substitute
To get through one night a day

One step away

I stay up with the late, late show
Just another way I know
To get through one night a day

When our baby Kate was born it was the biggest day of my life
Lying there, little bows in her hair
In the loving arms of my wife
I was the proudest papa in the USA
Makin' a living on the road somewhere a thousand miles away

It was a happy day, but kinda' sad
And I wish I coulda' been there
Yea I wish I coulda' been there
I wish I coulda been there for that

Little Bobby hit his first home run
He was the hero of the home town crowd
Two to one, it was a winning run
Everybody was cheering loud
And mommy she was smilin' saying he's a chip off of the old block
But I was on the road somewhere between Memphis and Little Rock

It was a happy day but kinda' sad
And I wish I coulda' been there
Yea I wish I coulda' been there
I wish I coulda' been there for that

Now Bobby and Kate are all grown up
And moved away
They stay in touch
We're proud of the two good kids we raised
And it's hard to believe we are celebrating our twenty fifth year today
This party's nice but the kids aren't here
At least they called to say
Congratulations mom and dad

I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there for that
It was a happy day, but kinda' sad
And I wish they could have been there
Yea I wish they could have been there
I wish they could have been there, for that

When you hit rock bottom
You've got two ways to go
Straight up and sideways
I have seen my share of hard times
And I'm letting you know
Straight up is my way
Things are tough all over
But I've got good news
When you get down to nothing
You've got nothing to lose
I was born naked
But I'm glory bound
And a dead end street is just a place to turn around
When the sky is the limit up on easy street
Rock bottom ain't no place to be
Rock bottom ain't no place for me no no
When the law of the jungle is the law of the land
Good luck staying alive
I keep a clenched fist under this hat in my hand
Cause only the strong survive
Things are tough all over
But I've got good news
When you get down to nothing
You've got nothing to lose
Anyway rock bottom is good solid ground
And a dead end street is just a place to turn around
When the sky is the limit up on easy street
Rock bottom ain't no place to be
Rock bottom ain't no place for me no no

So pour me a lone star
Tonight I'll be drinkin' alone, all alone
She said we'd never part...she never broke my heart

And there ain't a cow in Texas
And Wheaties ain't for breakfast
Late at night she'll never cross my mind
There ain't no rose of San Antone

'Cause cowboys don't cry

Why's that old radio playin'
That same country song as I drive along
Guess by now she knows that she
Was the one who was wrong, all along
Bet she's missing me tonight...
Bet she'd like to make things right

In the backyard playin' in a big mud hole
I was all decked out, ready for church
Had my brand new suit all covered in dirt

Mama hit the ceilin', she was fit to be tied
Talkin' 'bout how she's gonna tan my hide

Sayin' mama leave the boy alone

'Cause if the good die young, if the good die young
Our little boy's gonna have a lot of fun
'Cause he's gonna live forever if the good die young

Constable clocked me at a hundred and four

You'd a long been dead if you was anybody else

Oh, there ain't a sentence gonna hold you son
'Cause your gonna live forever if the good die young""

Well I got a good heart, I wouldn't hurt a soul
But I'm gonna keep rockin' til they call that roll

I'm gonna go to Heaven but I might be late

'Cause if the good die young, Lord if the good die young
Pedal to the metal, let your motor run
'Cause I'm gonna live forever if the good die young

She still answers whenever I call
We talk about work and the weather and all
If I mention the past or maybe coming back home
It ain't long till I hear that old cold dial tone

I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore

She says her job is hectic but it's beautiful outside
She might call in sick tomorrow and just take a drive
I said I'd really love to see you can I meet you somewhere
And then the conversation fades and long distance fills the air

I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
I still got her number but I can't reach her
I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before

Remember when we'd spend the whole night lovin
We just had to be together all the time
So much in love we didn't want for nothing
Back when I was yours and you were mine

Somehow we let it slip right through our fingers
Somewhere we left our love along the way
Now after all thre life we've lived between us
How can we have nothing more to say

Let's put aside the pain and all the sorrow
Stop talking bout the way things mighta been
If we'd only throw our hearts into tomorrow
Tonight we just might fall in love again

Remember how we lived on hopes and wishes
Remember when we lived for love alone
Just getting by on one another's kisses
Back before the sweetness turned to stone

Let's put aside the pain and all the sorrow
Stop talking bout the way things mighta been
If we'd only throw our hearts into tomorrow
Tonight we just might fall in love again

I keep on remembering
How good it used to be
Gettin' stoned all alone
On my favorite memory

1686,David Lee Murphy,40,Just Once,1994,"

A man can't look at a woman too long
Who looks like you without having thoughts
Run through his head and straight past his heart
Well, I might not stand a ghost of a chance
You're a one man woman not a one night stand
You're not the kind to let it go that far
But I wouldn't think twice
If you ever changed your mind

Just once, what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once, I'd love to know what it's like
Just once, before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice

Gazing into your big brown eyes
Tonight, I'm a little bit hypnotized
What makes a man put himself through this
I can't count the times I've held my breath
As you walked past to control myself
I think it's time to get it off my chest
So what I'd like to say
If I had my way

Just once, what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once, I'd love to know what it's like
Just once, before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice

If you changed your mind
Well, I wouldn't think twice

Just once, what I wouldn't do
To get my arms on a woman like you
Just once, I'd love to know what it's like
Just once, before I die
What I wouldn't give for just one night
Just once or twice
Just once or twice

"
1687,Aaron Tippin,41,Whole Lotta Love On The Line,1994,"

I've called from every run down phone booth in Atlanta, Georgia
Tryin' to find someone to tell me where you'd gone
I begged and pleaded with your mama 'til she gave me this number
Honey, we can work it out
Just come back home

'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line

All this distance that's come between us has gone far enough
And now I know that closer to you is where I belong
And that feelin' I'm feelin' inside is what I'm tryin' to send through these wires
Oh, darling who cares
Who's right or who's wrong

'Cause there's a whole lotta love on the line
And all I need is a chance to change your mind
Don't hang up the phone, 'cause everything's not gone
Think about it, baby
There's a whole lotta love on the line

"
1688,Alan Jackson,42,(Who Says) You Can't Have It All,1994,"

[Verse 1]
A stark-naked light bulb hangs over my head
There's one lonely pillow on my double bed
I've got a ceiling, a floor and four walls

[Refrain]
Who says you can't have it all

[Verse 2]
My room's decorated with pictures of you
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
I've got precious memories at my beck and call

[Refrain]
Who says you can't have it all

[Verse 3]
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Oh, I'm doing fine don't you worry about me
Because I'm Lord and Master of a fool's Taj Mahal

[Refrain]
Who says you can't have it all

[Verse 3]
I've got everything a broken heart needs
Oh, I'm doing fine don't you worry about me
Because I'm Lord and Master of a fool's Taj Mahal

[Refrain]
Who says you can't have it all

Oh, who says you can't have it all

1689,Tim McGraw,43,Indian Outlaw,1994,"

[Intro]
I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 1]
All my friends call me Bear Claw
The Village Chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey and pass it around

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 2]
I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 3]
I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't you know
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Bridge]
Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

1690,Little Texas,44,Stop On A Dime,1994,"

Start out easy, take it slow
Once you get started
You don't know where love will go
But you think you're ready for another time around
It's nothing you can't handle
And you think you've got it down

Chorus:
So you fall in love and it picks you up
And it takes your heart for a ride
After too many bad roads this heartbroken fool knows
That love can mess with your mind
Cause love can stop on a dime

Next thing you know, you've gone too fast
And you'd do anything just to try to make it last
But you keep on going even though you see the signs
Still believing that it won't go wrong this time

Chorus:
So you fall in love and it picks you up
And it takes your heart for a ride
After too many bad roads this heartbroken fool knows
That love can mess with your mind
Cause stop on a dime

Now it's over, said and done
Just another love you thought would be the one
You don't know where you're going
But you don't like where you've been
You try to tell yourself you won't go back again

Chorus
Cause you fall in love and it picks you up
And it takes your heart for a ride
After too many bad roads this heartbroken fool knows
That love can mess with your mind
Cause love can stop on a dime

Love can stop...on a dime

"
1691,Suzy Bogguss,45,You Wouldn't Say That To A Stranger,1994,"

I don't know why we act like that
You hurt me, I only hurt you back
I can't believe how carelessly we say those things
That put our love in danger

You wouldn't say that to a stranger, we hurt the ones we love
When we say those words in anger, do we ever make it up
We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger

Last night, there was over in the air
Toda,y it's gone just like it was never there
And I don't know where those hateful words come from
It goes against our nature

You wouldn't say that to a stranger, we hurt the ones we love
When we say those words in anger, do we ever make it up
We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger

Let's pretend that we just met
And we said nothing we regret

We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger...

"
1692,Martina McBride,46,Independence Day,1994,"

[Verse 1]
Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So, I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

[Verse 2]
Well, word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

[Chorus]
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day

[Verse 3]
Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now, I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

[Chorus]
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day

[Outro]
Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day

"
1693,Lee Roy Parnell,47,Take These Chains From My Heart,1994,"

Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

1694,Sammy Kershaw,48,National Working Woman's Holiday,1994,"

(Roger Murrah/Pat Terry/James Dean Hicks)
(Track 4 - Time 3:11)

They oughta' run your picture in a magazine
'Cause you're the hardest working woman I've ever seen
If we weren't sinkin' in a river of debt
I'd say, ""Quit that job and let 'em do it theirself""
I know we're depending on every dime
But I'm tired of you working that overtime

I'm gonna tell somebody
There ought to be a law against working that way
Tell 'em you're taking off this Friday
For the National Working Woman's Holiday

Honey I can tell you're feeling the strain
You deserve a break from that ball and chain
If the union won't say it, then it's up to me
They're just taking advantage of your loyalty
Everybody likes a little time and a half
But we both know you're worth more than that

I'm gonna tell somebody
There ought to be a law against working that way
Tell 'em you're taking off this Friday
For the National Working Woman's Holiday

I'll call in sick
And I'll be telling the truth
'Cause I'm sick and tired
Of how they're treating you

I'm gonna tell somebody
There ought to be a law against working that way
Tell 'em you're taking off this Friday
For the National Working Woman's Holiday

I'm gonna tell somebody
There ought to be a law against working that way
Tell 'em you're taking off this Friday

1695,Dwight Yoakam,49,Try Not To Look So Pretty,1994,"

Try not to look so pretty
Next time that we meet
Please don't look so pretty
And I won't act so weak

Please don't look so pretty
You're lovely but it's just cruel
Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your fool

You walk in and steal my mind
Oh, but who gave you the right
To treat me like some useless thought
You throw away each night

(Chorus)

You make it hard on me
Oh, but I'll try to pretend
That you're just a lovesick dream
That always has to end

(Chorus)

Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your fool

1696,John And Audrey Wiggins,50,Falling Out Of Love,1994,"

(John Wayne Wiggins)

Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
I can't believe your memory didn't keep me awake
My heart's not beating the missing you blues
And my eyes ain't crying for you

All those wasted nights I've sat and cried
Waiting for you knowing that you wouldn't come by
I look back and laugh at the fool I've been
I'll never set foot in them shoes again

This must be what falling out of love feels like
I don't mind if I do
Feeling like I don't care feels real nice
I don't toss and turn with your memory all night
Must be what falling out of love feels like

I don't jump when the telephone rings
Don't pace the floor, pull my hair and scream
I eat a lot better with an appetite
And sleep comes easy at night

I got no problems, there ain't nothing wrong
As a matter of fact I never felt so strong
I feel like shouting out I'm over you
I think I'll call my Momma up and tell her the news

This must be what falling out of love feels like
I don't mind if I do
Feeling like I don't care feels real nice
Saying it's over, knowing I'm right
Must be what falling out of love feels like

"
1697,Ty Herndon,1,What Mattered Most,1995,"

[Verse 1]
I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
So if she's gone the fault is mine
I know, I know a whole lot of little things
And even though I confess them one by one
She would still be gone

[Chorus]
Her eyes are blue, her hair is long
In '64 she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is ""In My Life""
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her cloths
But I paid no attention to what mattered most

[Verse 2]
I never asked, she never said
And when she cried I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors
That made them easy to ignore
And I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees
And all I have to show oh when she walked out the door
The cold facts and nothing more

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Her eyes are blue, her hair is long
In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge
Her father's tall, her mother's gone
She moved out west when she was two
The way she laughed, the way she loved
Oh my God what did I do

"
1698,John Berry,2,Standing On The Edge Of Goodbye,1995,"

It's been a long time since I held her close
We misplaced feelings that we used to know
Thought I could see between the lines I read
I wasn't ready we she turned to me and said

I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why. Now I can't lie...
I'm standing on the edge of goodbye

All of the those years came rushin through my mind
I found myself back.. in a simpler time
Just two young kids runnin on fire and dreams
And in her eyes I realized, she was calling out to me

She said, I can't eat and I can't sleep

Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why. Now I can't lie...
I'm standing on the edge of goodbye. Goodbye

I would do anything to let her know
There just no way my heart can, let her go

'Cause I can't eat and I can't sleep
Sometimes I find it hard to breathe
I breakdown and cry not knowing why. Now I can't lie...
She's standing on the edge of goodbye. Goodbye

Standing on the edge of goodbye...
Standing on the edge of goodbye...
Standing on the edge of goodbye...

1699,Clint Black,3,Summer's Comin',1995,"

Nothin' on Earth that'll get me hummin'
Like a heat wave comin' and I'll come runnin'
With her makin' that tan in the broad daylight
And every night is a Saturday night
And everything's right with the summer comin'
I'm the first one standin' in line
For my day in the sun I've been workin' 'til the sun don't shine
Takin' off my hat leave it to the boys
Get that old work monkey down off my back
All I want's a little peace and noise
Hit the cruise control get me back on track
Let my old Ford treat me like a Cadillac

Repeat Chorus

When the day gets cookin' gonna grab my toys
And it really doesn't matter which wave we're on
Get to turnin' up them good old boys
Crankin' into the night, by the break of dawn
All the towns are red and I still see blonde

Repeat Chorus

For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
For my day in the sun I've been workin'
'Til the sun don't shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin' to shine
Summer's comin'

1700,George Strait,4,Adalida,1995,"

[Chorus]
Adalida, pretty little cajun queen
Sweet dixie flower, the belle of the bayou
You're every young man's dream
Adalida, I'd walk through a hurricane
To stand beside you sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Pontchartrain

[Verse 1]
Oh no, here you coming down the road
With your cotton dress a swishing
You getting some attention
From all the boys in Thibodaux
Oh my, you really filling up their eyes
Smiling and a winking
I know what they're thinking
But I'm the only one who loves you so!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know
I know you can tell it
You making me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me, you could make a redneck green
The way that you're a looking
You got me cooking
And I ain’t talking 'bout Etoufee'

[Chorus 2x]

1701,Toby Keith,5,You Ain't Much Fun,1995,"

[Verse 1]
I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barking like a dog, howling at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' red hen, up all night wonderin' where I been
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

[Verse 2]
Now I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
I guess I gone out and lost all my good sense
Too much work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin', now I'm killing myself
Now I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

[Verse 3]
Now I'm fixin' the sink and I'm mowin' the grass
You made me a list and I'm bustin' my, wheel
All broke down, tailspin draggin'
It's a tough ol' life up here on the wagon
Now I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
Yeah, I sobered up, and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

1702,Mark Chesnutt,6,Gonna Get A Life,1995,"

Gotta find somethin' to ease my mind
Gotta get it off of you
You tear at my heart strings one more time
With what you're puttin' me through
I'm not much on hangin' around
Where I'm not wanted at all
I'm not gonna be your love sick clown
Waitin' for your beck and call

I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one

This'll be the last time you spin your wheels
Leaving like a maniac

There's no need in comin' back

So startin' now
You can find one too

I keep rollin' it over and over
All the things I want to say
I'll never quit, give up, or forget you
My love will stand in the way

'Cause I don't believe in goodbye
And I believe it takes time
To build something strong, it won't take long
For you to believe in me, just look in my eyes
I don't believe in goodbye

Where love goes, we must follow
And let our hearts lead the way
We'll be the last of the true believers
First in love and last to stay

'Cause I don't believe in goodbye
And I believe it takes time
To build something strong, it won't take long
For you to believe in me, just look in my eyes

1704,Hal Ketchum,8,Stay Forever,1995,"

Maybe I pray too much, maybe I'm wastin God's time
Livin without your touch, is driving me out of my mind
If you could only see, how much you matter to me
Maybe you would stay forever

Maybe I care too much, maybe I'll push you away
Maybe I'd have my doubts, if I were in your place
And if you could see inside, this achin heart of mine
Maybe you would stay forever

You don't have to go on livin
With your back against the wall
Let my lovin arms surround you
I won't let you fall

And if you would trust in me, and this love of mine
We'll sail an endless sea, under a starry sky
And when the cold wind blows, we'll hold each other close
Maybe you will stay forever

And when the cold wind blows, we'll hold each other close
Baby you will stay forever

1705,Alison Krauss + Union Station,9,When You Say Nothing At All,1995,"

[Verse 1]
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall

1707,Tracy Lawrence,11,Texas Tornado,1995,"

You called me up from Amarillo, said you were comin' to town
And thought I'd like to tell you hello, and drive an old friend around
I pulled up to the airport, confident and cool
But when you stepped off that plane, I knew I was your fool

My little Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed, in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away, again

You're lyin' with me in Atlanta, it's such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano, I always let you get by
I know I'll go through hell girl, when you find someone else
But right now I'm in heaven, and I can't help myself

My little Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed, in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away, again

I'm like a tumbleweed, in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away

Fading
Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed, in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away

Texas tornado, blowin' me away again

1708,Wade Hayes,12,I'm Still Dancin' With You,1995,"

(Chick Rains/Wade Hayes)

I'm sittin' here surrounded by people I know
The beer's cold and the music's good and loud
That used to be enough to put a smile on my face
But tonight I just feel lost in this crowd

There's a brunette on the dance floor
That smiled a time or two
So I got up and asked her for a dance
But when she put her arms around me
And I held her I knew
It was just too soon to take another chance

'Cause I'm still dancin' with you
I know we said we were through
But I keep holdin' on
Letting go is just too hard to do
Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with you

When the song was over, I held on a little longer
Deep inside I knew that it was wrong
I could hold her in my arms for the rest of the night
But I'd just be leading her on

'Cause I'm still dancin' with you
I know we said we were through
But I keep holdin' on
Letting go is just too hard to do
Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with you

Even when I'm holding someone new
I'm still dancin' with you

1709,Doug Stone,13,Faith In Me  Faith In You,1995,"

A single mother with two children make lunches in the mornin’
And on her way to work, she drops ‘em off at school
And tells them, faith in me, faith in you
A farmer kneels in his fields with dust pourin’ through his fingers
Says I’m gonna lose you if it don’t rain real soon
He looks up and says, faith in me, faith in you

[Chorus]
Oh! Oh! I have to have faith
That’s where it all starts
I know I have to have faith in myself
It’s feelin’ that’s found right here in my heart
And when I think about things and all the dreams I wanna see come true
Let me tell you just what I do…
I take a look in the mirror and I smile and say have faith in me, faith in you

In the shadow of the city, by the banks of the river
From the doorway of his cardboard room
A man cries out, faith in me, faith in you
Your form of poverty and prejudice over hunger and pain
Over social injustice, just watch as the bosses rein
Here ‘em saying, faith in me, faith in you

[REPEAT Chorus]
I take a look in the mirror and I smile and say have faith in me… faith in you

1710,Patty Loveless,14,You Don't Even Know Who I Am,1995,"

She left the car in the driveway
She left the key in the door
She left the kids at her mama's
And the laundry piled up on the floor
She left her ring on the pillow
Right where it wouldn't be missed
She left a note in the kitchen
Next to the grocery list

It said, you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do you care if I go

He left the ring on the pillow
He left the clothes on the floor
And he called her to say he was sorry
But he couldn't remember what for
So he said I've been doing some thinking
I've been thinking that maybe you're right
I go to work every morning
And I come home to you every night

And you don't even know who I am
You left me a long time ago
You don't even know who I am
So what do I care if you go
You don't even know who I am
So what do I care if you go

"
1711,Collin Raye,15,If I Were You,1995,"

You want to know where we go from here
So many roads, but none that seem clear
Is what we have enough to last a whole life through?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

So you're asking me 'what do we do'?
'Cause time moves so fast, and the chances seem so few
Is it too much to think that we could have it all?
Who knows? We may never know

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all it's worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

So hold me close, I'll kiss away your fears
I won't promise the moon, but I promise to be here
And what if together it gets better everyday?
Who knows? Baby, who knows?

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all its worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

But if I were you I'd promise to live life for all its worth
Take all that you've been given and leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart to show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you, I'd fall in love with me

If I were you, I'd fall in love with me

"
1712,Tracy Byrd,16,The Keeper Of The Stars,1995,"

[Verse 1]
It was no accident
Me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
Now I just can't believe
You're in my life
Heaven's smilin' down on me
As I look at you tonight

[Chorus]
I tip my hat
To the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what He was doin'
When He joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

[Verse 2]
Soft moonlight on your face
Oh, how you shine
It takes my breath away
Just to look into your eyes
I know I don't deserve
A treasure like you
There really are no words
To show my gratitude

[Chorus]
So I tip my hat
To the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what He was doin'
When He joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

[Outro]
It was no accident
Me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew

1713,Travis Tritt,17,Tell Me I Was Dreaming,1995,"

When I woke up this morning
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
I found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realize
You're gone

Tell me I was dreaming
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say
You don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

I'm in a state of confusion
I hope things aren't what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
You're home

Tell me I was dreaming
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say
You don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

Tell me I was dreaming (tell me I was dreaming)
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say
You don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination telling lies
Oh, tell me that you didn't say goodbye
Darlin', tell me
You didn't say
Goodbye

1714,Sammy Kershaw,18,If You're Gonna Walk  I'm Gonna Crawl,1995,"

(Buddy Cannon/Larry Bastian)
(Track 9 - Time 2:21)

I'm a Monday night football, Friday night pool hall guy
I ain't never been one to let a good time pass me by
You're standin' there statin' you're tired of waitin'
My celebratin's gratin' on you
If you feel that way if it'll make you stay
Well here's what I'm gonna do

If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
You'll see how low a man can go
When his back's against the wall
I'll be grovelin' in the gravel
If you make that taxi call
If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl

You're a one man pure gold genuine good ol' girl
You've been waitin' on me to get tired of my neon world
Now the turn you've taken has got me shakin'
It's a heart breakin' wake up call
Now I'm seein' how you see me
And I feel about shoe top tall

If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
You'll see how low a man can go
When his back's against the wall
I'll be grovelin' in the gravel
If you make that taxi call
If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl

1715,Kenny Chesney,19,Fall In Love,1995,"

[Verse 1]
A little country church on a two lane road
A bride and groom coming out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet

[Chorus]
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Old folks sitting in a front porch swing
Still holding' hands like they were sixteen
Fifty good years they're a lover's dream
Darling' that could be you and me

[Chorus]
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Yeah, yeah
Don't that make you want to fall in love

1716,Neal McCoy,20,They're Playin' Our Song,1995,"

[Verse 1]
Somebody's at the front door
I can hear 'em knockin'
Your mama's on the phone and she feels like talkin'
There's chicken on the barbecue, barbecuein'
Don't worry about it baby just
Drop what you're doing

[Chorus]
'Cause they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go
A million watts of love power comin' on strong
Dance with me darlin', they're playin' our song

Oh, the house needs cleanin'
The grass needs mowin'
We both got places that we need to be goin'
Tomorrow's a big day
Better get ready
But tonight it's just you and me rockin' steady

'Cause they're playin' our song on the radio
Okay Mister D.J. atta way to go

1717,Alan Jackson,21,Song For The Life,1995,"

[Verse 1]
Well I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately, it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
They pass quicker, like when I was a child

[Chorus]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

[Chorus][x2]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

She keeps my feet on the ground

1718,Mary Chapin Carpenter,22,House Of Cards,1995,"

[Verse]
I grew up in a house like this
You knew the groan of every stair
All the walls seemed to listen in
All the years seemed to take up air
When you dreamed it was of the wind
Blowing cold and hard
In those dreams you thought
You lived in a house of cards
And I grew up in a town like this
You knew the names of every street
On the surface it looked so safe
But it was perilous underneath
That's the place where you shoved
Your doubts and hid your ugly scars
God forbid if word got out
About your house of cards
And now I feel the wind about to blow
Baby I'm so scared
We're repeating the past
Instead of letting it go
And I don't want to go back there
Now we're standing here face to face
Afraid to move or else
I want to prop up this fragile place
But I can't do it all by myself
Because when we dream it's of the wind
Blowing cold and hard
When we wake up we still live
In a house of cards
When we dream it's of the wind
Blowing cold and hard
When we wake up we still live in a house of cards

1719,Brooks & Dunn,23,Little Miss Honky Tonk,1995,"

[Verse 1]
I get out on the redneck side every now and then
Call up my baby she comes over and the party begins
She's a slick nickel she's right on the money
I wouldn't give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk
She's got my number, knows my favourite songs on the jukebox
Goes to getting down like crazy and the whole place rocks
We'll have a few and get to feeling right
She'll be my queen bee I'll be her neon knight
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

[Chorus]
Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room
Boys and watch her go

[Verse 2]
She's a looker, heads turn when she comes through the door
A show stopper when she gets to going out on the floor
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

1720,Kathy Mattea,24,Clown In Your Rodeo,1995,"

Hey there little cactus flower your ways are sharper than a knife
And they cause the heart to bleed
You think that love is flower well baby you abused the right to rule over me
Cause love should keep you feeling warm and all right
But when I'm close to you I just get frostbite

I ain't gonna be the clown in your rodeo I ain't gonna be the freak in your fair
I ain't gonna be the floor for your do-si-do
No baby gonna dust you off and ride on out of here

Hey there little bronco buster
Did you think you had me trained to meet your every whim
Well hand me my feather duster
I'm cleaning house I'll end the game before my heart starts caving in
Cause this love affair has taken me through hell some
Now I believe that I've worn out my welcome

I ain't gonna be the clown...
( dobro - fiddle )
Cause love should keep...
I ain't gonna be the clown...

"
1721,David Lee Murphy,25,Party Crowd,1995,"

She couldn't keep from cryin' when she told me goodbye
I knew Lord it was breakin' her heart, and she was breakin' mine
So for the sake of her feelings and the sake of my pride
I told her not to worry 'bout me
So I'm sittin' here soakin' up the neon lights
Misery looking for some company

Tonight I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox a jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

It'll dawn on me tomorrow wherever I wake up
I'll look back and try to recall just where the heck's my truck
So take my keys and lock em up tight, let the good times flow
I'll worry bout tomorrow when it comes to light
The night's still young and I'm on a roll

Tonight I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox a jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

Tonight I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox a jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

Tonight I'm lookin' for a party crowd
Slammin' 'em back and laughing out loud
Where the smoke's so thick the blues can't hang around
With the jukebox a jumpin' like it just don't care
If they're dancin' over here or fightin' over there
I'm makin' the rounds, looking for a party crowd

1722,4 Runner,26,Cain's Blood,1995,"

CHORUS
Half of my blood is Cain's blood
Half of my blood is Abel's
One eye looks to Heaven
One eye looks for trouble
Sweet mother, she sang in the Sunday choir
On her head was a halo, she spoke brimstone and fire
Daddy lived by the bottle, Daddy died by the barn
Well, he froze one night, Mama said ""Serves him
Right""
""The devil can keep him warm""
CHORUS
Guess I always saw myself as a simple man
But there's a man in the mirror I don't understand
Every day I fight it, but I know down deep
It's the secrets I've been keeping
Rising from their sleep
CHORUS
There's an angel and a devil playing tug of war with
My soul (Half of my blood is Cain's blood)
The battle rages on each and every day (Half of my blood is Abel's)
It's all I can do just to try to maintain control (Half of my blood is
Cain's
Blood)
My one and only hope(one and only hope) is to my knees and pray

"
1723,John Anderson,27,Mississippi Moon,1995,"

It's a late night show on the radio
Going down the road with the Wolfman
Lightning bugs all around moonlight shining down
On little sleepy towns down in the flatlands

I can still hear momma calling son it's time to come on in
When the darkness started falling...
Everybody gathered round the table, amen

Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze wish I'd never left you
Spent enough time in that old rat race
Goin on back in the delta

Barbecues, back porch stews, and the guitar blues just about sundown
Mockingbird melodies, watermelon memories...
Cruisin the streets downtown

Hot summer night down on the levy
She spread the blanket on the ground
There ain't no feeling like the first time
When the innocence is lost and love is found

Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze almost reach and touch you
Been a long time and I missed your face
Goin on back to the delta

I'm tired of searching for the answers
Always out there on the run
I'm goin back to where my heart is...
Down on Highway 61

Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze almost reach and touch you
Been a long time and I missed your face
Goin on back to the delta

Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze wish I'd never left you
Had enough time in that old rat race
Goin on back to the delta

1724,BlackHawk,28,That's Just About Right,1995,"

[Verse 1: Blackhawk]
My old friend lives up in the mountains
He says, even though interpretation's
What I count on, this little picture to me
Seems blurred, hard lines and the shadows come easy
I see it all just as clear as a bell
I just can't seem to set my easel to please me
I paint my heaven but it looks like hell

[Chorus]
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
It's just about right

[Verse 2]
He said, man I ain't coming down 'til my picture is perfect
And all the wonder is gone from my eyes
Down through my hands and onto the canvas
Still like my vision but still a surprise
Real life he says is the hardest impression
It's always moving so I let it come through
That my friend I say is the glory of true independence
Just to do what you do, what you do, what you do

[Chorus]
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
It's just about right

[Verse 3]
My old friend came down from the mountain
Without even looking he found a little truth
You can go through life with the greatest of intentions
But you do what you do, what you just gotta do

[Chorus]
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
That's just about right
That's just about right, yeah

1725,Alabama,29,Give Me One More Shot,1995,"

Life ain't all that easy I can testify to that
It's been up and down and round and round to get to where I'm at
If you could see how I'm living in this old car I drive
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even wanna stay alive

Chorus:
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day

Well I could complain about taxes or the weather we're having today
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to L.A
Well that's just not my nature to sit around feeling sad
We're only here for awhile so why not smile hey living ain't all that
Bad

CHORUS

When I look around there's lots of folks worse off than me
So I just thank the good Lord and ask him please

CHORUS

Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day
Give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got give me one more day
Show me the way, and give me one more day
Give me one more shot

Fit to be tied bustin' at the seams
Got a bead on me she's a shootin' this way
I'm under the gun should I run or stay

On one hand I'm thinkin' that I better lay low
But then on the other what a way to go
What kind of fix have I got me into
Darned if I don't and danged if I do

[Verse 1:]
I know it ain't none of my business
When it comes to the affairs of your heart
It's really hard for me to say this
But you trouble's gettin' ready to start
Well I've heard you say how much you love him
You think someday you'll be his bride
Baby, you just can't trust him
'Cause I've known the boy all of my life

[Chorus:]
So you better think twice before you roll the dice
You better think twice before you give you heart away

[Verse 2:]
You really must think I'm something
Talkin' trash about my best friend
I just hate to se eyou wind up with nothing
'Cause you're way too good for him
And I know that you don't believe me
But I've been with him when he's runnin' around
He don't mean to hurt nobody
He ain't never gonna settle down

You better think twice[x4]

[Verse 1]
Last Monday mornin', you left with no warnin'
I started goin' insane
Well, I headed South out of Del Rio, Texas
With a hell of a load on my brain
And I kept on goin' without even knowin'
How much your love really means
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

[Chorus]
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

[Verse 2]
This picture ain't pretty, I'm ragged and dirty
And wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Shootin' tequila, wantin' to kill you
And wishin' to God you were near
So full of your memory, but feelin' so empty
I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I'm messed up in Mexico
Livin' on refried dreams

[Chorus]
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

[Chorus]
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

Oh, I'm messed up in Mexico

1729,Reba McEntire,33,The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter,1995,"

She came in looking good and looking around
She's checking out every man in the room right now
Now don't go telling her about right or wrong
She's been alone way too long

And the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

She hears him say- ""Hey can I buy you a drink""
Then sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring
She knows that he is dealing her a dangerous hand
The consequences of a one night stand

But the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

From somewhere deep inside she tells him ""no""
Before she starts to cry she turns to go

Cuz the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

1730,Trisha Yearwood,34,You Can Sleep While I Drive,1995,"

Come on baby, let's get out of this town
I got a full tank of gas
With the top rolled down
There's a chill in my bones
I don't want to be left alone
So baby you can sleep while I drive

I'll pack my bag and load up my guitar
In my pocket I'll carry my harp
I got some money I saved, enough to get underway
And baby you can sleep while I drive

We'll go through Tucson up to Santa Fe
And Barbara in Nashville says we're welcome to stay
I'll buy you boots down in Texas, a hat from New Orleans
And in the morning you can tell me your dreams
You know I've seen it before
This mist that covers your eyes
You've been looking for something that's not in your life
My intentions are true, won't you take me with you
And baby you can sleep while I drive

Oh is it other arms you want to hold you
The stranger, the lover, you're free
Can't you get that with me
Come on baby let's get out of this town
I've got a full tank of gas
With the top rolled down
If you won't take me with you
I'll go before night is through
And baby you can sleep while I drive

1731,Clay Walker,35,My Heart Will Never Know,1995,"

I pour two cups of coffee
Put the paper on the table
So we can share the morning news
Your voice answers our phone when we're not home
Friends who call leave a message here for you
Every night I leave the light on, you're just working late
As far as I can see everything is still the same

And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart
I fool myself for another day
That you're not really gone
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know

It's been a long cold December, the snow outside keeps fallin'
I'll light a fire when you get home
It reminds me of the first night we make love
Like it would last forever, and nothing could go wrong
You're a part of me, a part of everything I do
So I keep holding on, hiding from the truth

And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart
I fool myself for another day
That you're not really gone
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know

After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know

1732,John Michael Montgomery,36,Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident),1995,"

[Verse 1]
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that

[Chorus]
And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

[Verse 2]
Well the auctioneer was goin' 'bout a mile a minute
He was takin' bids and callin' them out loud
And I guess I was really gettin' in it
Cause I just shouted out above the crowd

[Chorus]
And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind

Well she won my heart it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah we found love on the auction block
And I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day

[Chorus]
When I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

1733,Trisha Yearwood,37,Thinkin' About You,1995,"

I'm not quite sure what's goin' on, but all day through and all night long
I've been thinkin' about you
I've been thinkin' about you

The look in your eyes when you smile that way
The sound of your voice sayin' my name
I've been thinkin' about you
Just keep thinkin' about you

This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love? If you don't then what?
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump the track that it's on

In the back of my mind, there's a secret place
But the whole world knows by the smile on my face
That I've been thinkin' about you
Can't stop thinkin' about you

This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love? Well if you don't then what?
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump the track that it's on

I know it's crazy, callin' you this late
When the only thing I wanted to say is
I've been thinkin' about you
Oh, just keep thinkin' about you

Oh, can't stop thinkin about you
I'm always thinkin' about you...
And I do love thinking about you.....

1734,Joe Diffie,38,So Help Me Girl,1995,"

[Verse 1: Joe Diffie]
You could've kissed me, like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from saying something I'll never take back
You could have held me like there was no chance
Of me waking up where I am
You could have stopped short of every dream I've ever had

[Chorus: Joe Diffie]
So help me girl
You've gone too far
It's way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

[Verse 2: Joe Diffie]
You had to be there when that old sun came up
Making last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else
Now look what you've gone and done
You had to love me 'til I just can't get enough

[Chorus: Joe Diffie]
So help me girl
You've gone too far
It's way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

[Chorus: Joe Diffie]
So help me girl
You've gone too far
It's way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

[Outro: Joe Diffie]
And I can't help myself, so help me girl

"
1735,Daryle Singletary,39,I'm Living Up To Her Low Expectations,1995,"

Found myself some brand new friends
Took up a few bad habits again
I partied every single night this week

Late for work three days in a row
When she left she was right I know
'Cause she said I'd never amount to anything

I'm living up to her low expectations
I'm becoming everything she said I'd be
I'm living up to her low expectations
'Cause her low expectations are high enough for me

I had to drop that night school class
Who's got the time when you're havin' a blast?
The waitress here thinks I'm the cutest thing

Boss told me didn't get that raise
But what the heck? That's okay
Because I never did deserve it anyway

I'm living up to her low expectations
I'm becoming everything she said I'd be
I'm living up to her low expectations
'Cause her low expectations are high enough for me

Yes, her low expectations are high enough for me

1736,Little Texas,40,Southern Grace,1995,"

(Porter Howell/Brady Seals/Stewart Harris)
(Track 4 - Time 5:42)

First time I felt the magic of her kiss
Was under a Carolina moon
Sweet Southern style
Tender but a little wild
For me no other love will ever do

Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace

You should see the way she walks into a room
It's almost like her feet don't touch the floor
But when the chips are down
Her feet are firmly on the ground
I could never ask for any more

Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace

She's got me fallin' in her eyes again tonight
Lost in lovin' arms as the world goes by

Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman

There ain't nothing like a woman
No there ain't nothing like my woman
Southern grace

"
1737,Clay Walker,41,This Woman And This Man,1995,"

Been trying so hard just to talk to you
Haven't heard half of what you want me to
I hurt so bad over where we've been
Don't know how not to go back there again
I know what I want to say
Can I get it through to you now
In some other way

Like there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman, this woman and this man

A strangers eyes in a lovers face
See no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door
I feel the need to reach out to you even more
It's a circle we're going round
If we don't get us out from under it's going to take us down

See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman, this woman and this man

For all we've got to lose, so much to gain
If we come this far and leave it behind
There's only you and me to blame

See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How can they be so in love and still never see
How they can get it back again
This woman, this woman and this man
Yeah we can get it back again
This woman, this woman and this man

1738,Shania Twain,42,Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under,1995,"

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal i wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
Whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 1]
Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal i wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 2]
I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal i wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

[Verse 3]
Come on boots
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

[Chorus]
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal i wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

[Outro]
I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby, tell me
Whose bed, yes i wanna know
You better start talking
Or you better start walking

1739,Lari White,43,That's How You Know (When You're In Love),1995,"

[Verse 1]
You can take a stranger home
Never spend the night alone
But you have to face the morning feeling empty inside
'Cause you can't pretend it's real
When what you really want to feel
Is the magic of the moment when love can't be denied

[Chorus]
When your heart makes a sound like rolling thunder
And your arms are wrapped around an angel from above
And when the earth begins to shake
'Cause it can feel the love you make
Oh oh oh that's how you know
When you're in love

[Verse 2]
I had all but given up
On ever finding love
Until I caught a glimpse of heaven when I looked into your eyes
And your fingers touched my skin
Like a stormy summer wind
Now I'm falling like the wind oh what a sweet surprise

[Chorus]
When your heart makes a sound like rolling thunder
And your arms are wrapped around an angel from above
And when the earth begins to shake
'Cause it can feel the love you make
Oh oh oh that's how you know
When you're in love

[Bridge]
All of God's creation starts to sing in harmony
And I know you can hear it baby, I know you believe

[Chorus]
When your heart makes a sound like rolling thunder
And your arms are wrapped around an angel from above
And when the earth begins to shake
'Cause it can feel the love you make
Oh oh oh that's how you know
When you're in love

1740,Lorrie Morgan,44,I Didn't Know My Own Strength,1995,"

[Verse 1]
I've been livin' with a heart on the mend
Wondering how will I ever be strong
I know I'll live to love again
I just leaned on you too long
It's been an uphill fight
But I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength

[Verse 2]
I've had oceans of tears to get through
And the weight of the world on my mind
There's been mountains of memories to lose
And I've been beating back the blows to my pride
But 'til the times got tough
I never knew what I was made of

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength

[Bridge]
Then the times got tough
And I knew what I was made of

[Chorus]
I didn't know my own strength
'Til I had to pick myself up
And carry on without your love
I'm gettin' back on my feet
It's been a long hard fall
But I'll make it after all
No, I didn't know my own strength

1741,Shania Twain,45,Any Man Of Mine,1995,"

[Intro]
This is what a woman wants...

[Verse 1]
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

[Chorus]
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

[Verse 2]
Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, ""Mmmm, I like it like that, yeah""

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

[Chorus]
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me hear you say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

[Chorus]
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

[Outro]
You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, Do Si Do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants...

1742,Randy Travis,46,The Box,1995,"

On the top shelf in the closet in the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dusty wooden box but I had never noticed till that time
Then we set it on the table and carefully we opened up the top
And stared into the memories daddy kept inside the box
There was a letter from mama when
She went out to Reno to help her sister out in sixty two
And a flower from Hawaii when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my daddy ever flew
And the pocket knife I gave to him on fathers day
Years ago I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
I guess we always knew it, but 'I love you' was hard for him to say
Some men show it easily and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see a softer side of someone I had lost
I saw the love he kept inside the first time when we opened up the box
There was a picture that was taken
When he and mom were dating standin' by his 1944
And the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptized
I guess no one understood him like the Lord
And the poem that he had written about his wife and children
The tender words he wrote were quite a shock
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box

Well it's a Monday mornin'
And I'm already watchin' the clock
I just got started
And I'm already ready to stop
By Wednesday I'll be movin' slow
My get up might not get up and go
But I'll be ok when that Friday whistle blows

(Chorus)
Workin' for the weekend all week long
Waitin' to wind up in some honky tonk
Listenin' to a country song
I'll have some money to spend on my girlfriend
When Friday comes a rollin' in
I'm workin' for the weekend, workin' for the weekend
I pull a forty hour week every week plus some overtime
That big boss man keeps a pushin' me to the line
I keep a workin' hard every day
I give an honest day's work
For an honest day's pay
And by the end of the week
I know I'll have it made in the shade

(Repeat chorus)
I'm workin' for the weekend, workin' for the weekend

1744,James House,48,This Is Me Missing You,1995,"

If you feel teardrops
Falling like rain on the rooftops
If you don't know what you're listening to
This is me missing you

If you seem lonely
Clear sky is turning stormy
Lightning strikes and all you see is blue
This is me missing you

(Chorus)
And while you're gone, this is the only way
To let you know your love is always safe

If you feel heartbreak
Distant thunder like an earthquake
If you wonder why the earth moves
This is me missing you

And while you're gone, this is the only way
To let you know your love is always safe

If you touch empty
Reach in the darkness and don't find me
Then you'll know just what I'm going through
This is me missing you

It wasn't the books that I didn't read
It wasn't the teachers who tried to teach me
It wasn't that varsity baseball coach
Kept on tellin' them locker room jokes

[Chorus]
It was Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 2]
Well Bobbie knew her hist'ry, Bobbie knew her French
Bobbie knew how to keep the boys in suspense
She'd tease with a touch, she'd tease with a kiss
I was three long years being teased by pretty Miss

[Chorus]
Bobbie Ann Mason back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 3]
Well Bobbie graduated first in her class
Me, I graduated closer to last
Bobbie went to college, she got a degree
I got a guitar so I could sing about

[Chorus]
Me and Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

[Verse 4]
Well the years have taught me the basics of math
Divorce divides and time subtracts
Takes away your hair, takes away your jump shot
But it ain't gonna take all the memories I've got of

[Chorus]
Bobbie Ann Mason back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason
Back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
I got most of my education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

Sweet Maria, the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

My Maria, there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back, my peace of mind

She treats me so right lady take me away

You swear you've had enough
You're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love
Then out of the blue clear sky

Falling right into your hands
Like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned
Then out of the blue clear sky

Here she comes, a walking talking true love
Saying I been looking for you love
Surprise, your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky

Ain't love a funny thing

And the next you're picking out a ring
Out of the blue clear sky

[Verse 1]
Her momma's still got that sequin gown that she wore in '68
She taught her early how to smile
That smile and wave from the parade
It took a whole lot of years and tears
For her momma to finally admit
No matter how many stitches and pins
That old dress was never gonna fit

[Chorus]
She was daddy's little girl
Momma's little angel
Teacher's pet, pageant queen
She said
""All my life I've been pleasing everyone but me
Waking up in someone else's dream""

[Verse 2]
Her daddy used to say
""You'll make a lovely bride someday""
He'll ride up on big white horse and just carry you away
It took twenty-five years and some broken vows
Before they'd finally see
There's a little more to love and life
Then fairytales and hand me down dreams

[Chorus]
She was daddy's little girl
Momma's little angel
Teacher's pet, pageant queen
She said
""All my life I've been pleasing everyone but me
Waking up in someone else's dream""

[Bridge]
Now she's got twenty-seven candles on her cake
And she means to make her life her own
Before there's twenty-eight

She was daddy's little girl
Momma's little angel
Teacher's pet, pageant queen
She said
""All my life I've been pleasing everyone but me
Waking up in someone else's dream""
She was daddy's little girl
Momma's little angel
Teacher's pet, pageant queen
She said
""All my life I've been pleasing everyone but me
Waking up in someone else's, someone else's dream
Waking up in someone else's dream""

Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your Daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

[Verse 2]
We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going

Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's been tailing us

Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter

1751,Billy Dean,5,It's What I Do,1996,"

Well I knew a man, he was a real go-getter
And what he did best was climb the ladder of success
How far he went was how he measured the worth of his life and who he was
But that's all behind me now because

Loving you it's what I do
It's the one thing I found I can put my heart into
It's who I am, I'm a lucky man living the life I choose
Loving you it's what I do

I do what I can to make an honest living
It's just a job it's not what I am living for
I wanna earn the love you're giving that's all that matters now to me
No matter what I'll always be

Loving you it's what I do
It's the one thing I found I can put my heart into
It's who I am, I'm a lucky man living the life I choose
Loving you it's what I do

Loving you it's what I do

Every time I see a woman on a billboard sign
I think about you
Saying, ""Drink this beer and you'll be mine""
I think about you

When an actress on a movie screen
Plays Lolita in some old man's dream
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you

When I see a pretty woman walking down the street
I think about you
Men look her up and down like she's some kind of treat
Oh, I think about you

She wouldn't dare talk to a stranger
Always has to be aware of the danger
Doesn't matter who she is
I think about you...

Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
And I can't help but see
That every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl
I think about you

Every time I hear people say it's never gonna change
I think about you
Like it's some kinda joke, some kinda game
Girl I think about you

When I see a woman on the news
Who didn't ask to be abandoned or abused
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you

Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
And I can't help but see that every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl
I think about you

Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
I think about you
Oh, I think about you
Baby I think about you

We agreed that it was over
Now the lines have all been drawn
The vows we made began to fade
But now they're gone
Put your pictures in a shoebox
And my gold ring in a drawer
I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Now Sherri says she's jealous
Of this freedom that I've found
If she were me she would be
Out on the town
And she says she can't imagine
What on Earth I'm waiting for
I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Chorus:
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where
And how you are
But I can't hide this hurt inside my
Broken heart
I'm fighting back emotions that I've
Never fought before
'Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Now I'm writing you this letter
And it's killing me tonight
That I agreed when you believed
It wasn't right
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed
So I'm down here on the floor
Where I'm not supposed to love you anymore

I'm fighting back emotions that I've
Never fought before
'Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Daddy's drinkin' beer listenin' to the radio

[Refrain]
Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John
And time marches on, time marches on

[Verse 2]
Sister's using rouge and clear complection soap
Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town

[Refrain]
Bob Dylan sings ""Like a Rolling Stone""
And time marches on, time marches on

[Bridge]
The South moves north, the North moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes, everything changes

[Verse 3]
Sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol
Mama's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree

[Refrain]
As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on

1755,Toby Keith,9,Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine On You,1996,"

[Verse 1]
Day by day, we let love just walk away
And I will be the first to say, I was glad to see it go
And day by day, ever since you went away
I find that I am still missing you, and I have just got to know

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you

[Verse 2]
On my mind, you were right there all the time
I could search and never find someone that does me like you do
Here is the part where I am giving you my heart
I was a fool to let you go, girl, I have just got to know

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you

[Verse 3]
Night after night, I look to the stars
Wondering where you might be
And I have thought to myself, is that very same moon
Shining on you, like it is shining on me

[Chorus]
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me, feel just like it used to be
And baby, if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you

"
1756,Tim McGraw,10,All I Want Is A Life,1996,"

[Verse 1]
I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that does not break down on the freeway
A little vacation, ain't askin' very much
I hate comin' home to this old broken down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that is in the carpet
Well, I do not want it all, but I ain't got enough

[Chorus]
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Verse 2]
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps tellin' me that everything is gettin' better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder
Just want to break even, someday before I die

[Chorus]
All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh

[Chorus]
Oh, all I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

[Outro]
All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life

1757,John Michael Montgomery,11,Long As I Live,1996,"

The world's been spinning 'round since time began
An' when it stops, it's out of my hands
So I could swear forever for all it's worth
Or give you every day I have on Earth

Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live

No matter if there's mountains you can't move
Or harder times then you thought you'd go through
And the weight of your world's too much to bear
Just remember I'll always be there

Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live

The moon and stars aren't mine to give
Neither is eternity
But I'll give you a promise tonight
That I can keep

Long as I live
Long as I breathe
With every heartbeat
I'll need you near me
I won't leave you behind
'Til the Lord says it's time to go with him
I'm yours long as I live
I'm yours long as I live

1758,BlackHawk,12,Almost A Memory Now,1996,"

She gets her things together, puts them by the door
She says, ""There's no love here anymore.""
I'll never be the same if she walks out
But she's almost a memory now

Wish I could turn her heart around
I feel so alone and she's not even gone
But she's almost a memory now

She hasn't even left, but I know she's gone
She never even said where we went wrong
One thing that I know without a doubt
She almost a memory now

I feel so alone and she's not even gone
But she's almost a memory now

Wish I could turn her heart around
I feel so alone, and she's not even gone
But she's almost a memory now
She's almost, she's almost
She's almost a memory
Wish I could turn her heart around

1759,Mindy McCready,13,Ten Thousand Angels,1996,"

[Verse 1]
Speakin' of the devil
Look who just walked in
He knows just where to find me
Here we go again
I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance
That's not as far as he wants to go
I need ten thousand angels
To help me tell him no

[Chorus]
Lead me not, into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight, all that I'm feelin'
But I can't do it alone
Help me break, this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels
Watchin' over me tonight

[Verse 2]
It's time to face my weakness
Look him in the eye
Lord knows it won't be easy
But I've just gotta try
I can't let myself get lost in his arms
That's how I got my heart broke before
I need ten thousand angels
To walk me out the door

[Chorus]
Lead me not, into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight, all that I'm feelin'
But I can't do it alone
Help me break, this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels
Watchin' over me tonight

I need ten thousand angels
Watchin' over me tonight
Ten thousand angels
Watchin' over me tonight
Ten thousand angels
Watchin' over me tonight
Watchin' over me tonight

1760,Terri Clark,14,If I Were You,1996,"

[Verse 1]
You were standing at my door
When I came home tonight
And I could tell by the look you gave me
You were needing my advice

[Verse 2]
You say you want more out of life than he can give you
As a tear rolls down your face
But girl, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I know someone who'd gladly take your place

[Chorus]
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through
If I were you

[Verse 3]
You shouldn't think you're missing out on something
Because you wear a wedding band
'Cause I can't seem to find somebody
Who wants more than just a one night stand

[Verse 4]
You know this single life I'm living
Ain't all it's cracked up to be
So you've come to the wrong place
If what you want is sympathy

[Chorus]
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life though
If I were you

[Verse 1:]
Whenever my soul is lonely
Whenever I'm feeling blue
I start thinkin' 'bout my blue eyed darlin'
And my heart starts pinin' for you

[Chorus:]
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound
'Cause my sweet baby ain't around
When my life's got me down
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound

[Verse 2:]
When I'm lost in this ocean of darkness
Not knowing which way I should turn
And my eyes are filled with sadness
Of knowing you'll never return

I wanna hear that high lonesome sound
'Cause my sweet baby ain't around
When my life's got me down
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound

1762,David Lee Murphy,16,Every Time I Get Around You,1996,"

(David Lee Murphy)

Well I can feel those wheels start turin' 'round honey
When ya walk into the room
The rest of the world fades right off into the blue
Yeah I'm off of the ground up in the clouds
Not sure which one I'm on
And I couldn't tell you what day it is baby
Not when your in my arms 'cause honey

I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you

You'd think by now I'd learned somehow
To keep under control
But girl you're the kind that makes man just wanna let go
I don't care about nothin' but your sweet lovin'
When you look at me that way
And sometimes when I'm holdin' you tight
I can't remember my name 'cause honey

I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you

I forget about everything every time I get around you
Girl it's like I got a one track mind all I wanna do
Is stare into those big brown eyes
It's almost like I'm hypnotized
Every time every time I get around you

1763,Alan Jackson,17,Home,1996,"

[Verse 1]
In small town down in Georgia
Over 40 years ago
Her maiden name was Musik
'Til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
But they believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same

[Verse 2]
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying days
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in a bind

[Chorus]
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

[Verse 3]
My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength and faith in God
And a love of family
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two

[Verse 4]
My daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let them look underneath the hood

[Chorus]
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

[Outro]
There'll never be another place in this world
That I'll call home

1764,The Mavericks (Featuring Flaco Jimenez),18,All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,1996,"

I can't sleep a wink anymore
Ever since you first walked out the door
Then I just started drinking to forget
But I don't think the worst has happend yet

Chorus
All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down

It's funny how my whole world fell apart
I think I saw it coming from the start
I tried to tell myself that you'd be true
But I expected way too much of you

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
That's cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
Honey all you ever do is bring me down

1765,Garth Brooks,19,The Change,1996,"

[Verse 1]
One hand reaches out, and pulls a lost soul from harm
While a thousand more, go unspoken for
And they say what good have you done, by saving just this one
It's like whispering a prayer, in the fury of a storm

[Chorus 1]
And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know, that it will not change me

[Verse 2]
This heart still believes, that love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage and so many say
That love is all but pointless, in madness such as this
It's like tryin' to stop a fire, with the moisture from a kiss

[Chorus 1]
And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world will know, that it will not change me

[Bridge]
As long as one heart still holds on
Then hope is never really gone

[Chorus 2]
And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so, this world we know, never changes me

[Outro]
What I do is so, this world will know, that it will not change me

1766,Shania Twain,20,You Win My Love,1996,"

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a lover
Who can rev his little engine up
He can have a '55 chevy
Or a fancy little pick-up truck
If he's got a cool cadillac
With a jacuzzi in the back I'm in, oh yeah
Cause I'm a classy little chassis
Who's a-huntin' for a heart to win

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but if you wanna win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows

A full of steam dream machine
Or just a little late night
Sexy long stretch limousine

Oh, but if you wanna win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows

[Chorus]
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love

1767,Wynonna,21,Heaven Help My Heart,1996,"

Two smilin' faces, that's how it used to be
What once was forever is now a faded memory
The perfect illusion for a while I guess it was
Without explanation the bloom fell off the rose
Heaven help my heart â€~cause it's a lot like me
I'm wonderin' when this all will end and I'll find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere, somehow I still believe
I'm asking please Heaven help my heart
This world can get crazy, these are troubled times
I'd walk through the fire if love is what I'd find
It's out of my hands now so I put my faith in you
And I say a little prayer and hope that it comes true
Heaven help my heart â€~cause it's a lot like me
I'm wonderin' when this all will end and I'll find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere, somehow I still believe
I'm asking please Heaven help my heart

1768,Jeff Carson,22,Holdin' On To Something,1996,"

There's a little girl, wanna make her mine
What she wants, I don't know
If red means stop and green means go
Her light is always yellow
I'm wrapped around her finger, she's slipping through my hands
Every time I think I got her, I gotta think again

I'm holdin' on to somethin'
That keeps lettin' me go
Just a whole lot of heartache
At the end of my rope
I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reachin', I can't stop
Holdin' on to somethin'
That keeps lettin' me go

She calls me on the phone, says she's all alone
Feelin' kind of lonely
Says she can't wait so don't be late:
I promise her I won't be
Ten minutes later i'm standin' at her door
She's sayin': ""Never mind, I ain't lonely anymore.""

I'm holdin' on to somethin'
That keeps lettin' me go
Just a whole lot of heartache
At the end of my rope
I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reachin', 'cause I can't stop
Holdin' on to somethin'
That keeps lettin' me go

Instrumental break

I fall a little harder every time I drop
But I keep reachin', an' I just can't stop
I'm holdin' on to somethin'
That keeps lettin' me go

1769,Reba McEntire,23,Starting Over Again,1996,"

[Verse 1]
Mama moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the king's horses
And all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Where should they begin
Because they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole word cries

[Verse 2]
He got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Sorting out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty odd years

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What will the neighbors say
They're talking talk, it's small town news
They're facing fifty years old, wrecking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools

1770,Lonestar,24,No News,1996,"

[Verse 1]
She said ""It's just a woman thing"" and pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry, I'm an understanding guy
I've heard that when you love someone you gotta let 'em go
She hollered ""When I find myself you'll be the first to know""
Ooh hoo no news

[Verse 2]
I learned to do the laundry, feed the cat, and clean the house
I promised to be patient while she worked her problems out
When she packed her bags, her destination wasn't clear
But I sensed that her intentions were honest and sincere
Ooh hoo no news

[Chorus]
She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse to no news

[Verse 3]
Her mama's been a little vague as to her whereabouts
Her sister says ""I'm certain your romance is headed south""
I don't have a single doubt that she's still in love
My level of anxiety is just a product of
Ooh hoo no news

[Chorus]
She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse

[Verse 4]
She missed her bus, missed her plane, surely this can be explained
Lost her car at the mall, got locked in a bathroom stall
Joined the cult, joined the klan, on the road with Pearl Jam
Buried with The Grateful Dead, came back as a Parrot Head
Got derailed, got de-iced, offered as a sacrifice
FBI, CIA, if they've seen her they ain't saying
No news
Still no news

1771,Lee Roy Parnell,25,Heart's Desire,1996,"

I can't think straight
Girl you're always on my mind
It's keepin' me up late
Can't even get to work on time

Got a fever burnin' up inside
I see your face each time I close my eyes

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

You walk by I can barely speak your name
You bat your eye and my courage goes down the drain
My chest is poundin' and I must confess

Girl, you're givin' me a cardiac arrest

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

Like a sweet tooth craving candy
I got such a longing I can hardly stand it

You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

My heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me
I think you oughta know
While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go

[Verse 1]
The first time I looked into your eyes
I knew this moment would arrive
I got a feelin' you're the one
But my heart keeps tryin' to turn and run
The problem is this happens every time

My heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me

While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong

If we can take this one kiss at a time
Maybe we can tame this heart of mine
I'm telling you the cold, hard truth
I ain't ever been loved by the likes of you
And I ain't ever had this much on the line

But my heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me

1773,Pam Tillis,27,The River And The Highway,1996,"

She follows the path of least resistance
She doesn't care to see the mountain top
She twists and turns with no regard to distance
She never comes to a stop

As she rolls, she's a river
Where she goes, time will tell
Heaven knows, he can't go with her
And she rolls, all by herself
And she rolls, all by herself

He's headed for a single destination
He doesn't care what's standing in his path
He's a line between two points of separation
He ends just where it says to on the map

As he rolls, he's a highway
Where he goes, time will tell
Heaven knows, she can't go with him
And he rolls, all by himself
And he rolls, all by himself

But every now and then
He offers her a shoulder
Every now and then
She overflows
Every now and then
A bridge crosses over
It's a moment, every lover knows

As she rolls (and he rolls)
She's a river (he's a highway)
Where she goes (where he goes)
Time will tell
Heaven knows
She can't go with him (he can't go with her)
And she rolls
All by herself
And he rolls
All by himself

Fare the well...

1774,Sammy Kershaw,28,Meant To Be,1996,"

(Chris Waters/Rick Bowles)

Well first I missed my plane
So I wound up on your flight
Then we got stuck in Dallas-Ft. Worth
Half the night
And the only vacant seat
You could find at gate twenty-nine
Was one next to mine

Call it fate
Destiny
Call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence
Circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh some things are meant to be

You said Atlanta was your home
Well I happened to live there too
I'd just broken up with someone and so had you
And when you said for everyone
There is someone they're meant to find
I knew I'd found mine

Call it fate
Destiny
Call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence
Circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh some things are meant to be

Coincidence
Circumstance
Or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh some things are meant to be
Baby some things are meant to be

"
1775,Sawyer Brown,29,Treat Her Right,1996,"

A lot of people breaking hearts these days
Giving up and just walking away
Forever's just another word
That you hear young lovers say
I know it may be old fashioned, but I still believe
Love stays when the strong winds blow
Even when it hurts, don't let go

Chorus
You've got to treat her right, understand
That she's your woman and you're her man
Tell her that you need her
Like the desert needs the rain
And if you treat her right, show her you care
When you need her she'll be there
Like an island in the storm, a beacon in the night
If you love her, treat her right

A good woman ain't easy to find
The faithful and the loving kind
And if you don't hold her tight
She'll slip right through your hands
Love gives more than it takes
So be willing for her sake
Stand by her when the strong winds blow
Even when it hurts, don't let go

Chorus
She's your best friend and your lover
So if you want to keep her
Take good care of her

If you treat her right, show her you care
When you need her, she'll be there
Like an island in the storm, a beacon in the night
If you love her treat her right

Treat her right
Treat her right

"
1776,Joe Diffie,30,C-O-U-N-T-R-Y,1996,"

I ain't never hauled hay in the trunk of my car
But I drunk a little shine from a mason jar
I know how to work and how ta have fun

I'm a good-timin', blue-collar, son-of-a-gun
I like monster trucks, tractor pulls, country fairs
Huntin' and fishin' and ice cold beer

That's the way I'm gonna be 'till the day I die
C-O-U-N-T-R-Y

My baby looks hot in her high heel shoes
She looks even cooler in her cowboy boots
She can dance to the music, all night long
She's a stick of dynamite, she's bad to the bone
She likes Boogy Woogy, Ragae, Rap, Pop, and Soul
Hip-Hop Blues, and Rock and Roll
If you really want to know what drives her wild, C-O-U-N-T-R-Y

You might not know it by the way we talk
We might not show it by the way we walk
But we're true and tried, genuine, certified, C-O-U-N-T-R-Y

That's the way we're gonna be until the day we die
C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
I said C-O-U-N-T-R-Y

"
1777,Patty Loveless,31,A Thousand Times A Day,1996,"

I gave up cigarettes
I haven't had to light one yet
And it's been a year since I stopped
The same goes for alcohol
I don't touch the stuff at all
And I used to drink till I dropped
Those were tough, this is easy
And it feels so good to say
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

Friends said it'd take some time
To get you off my mind
They thought I'd never let you go
Well, I guess I proved them wrong
One more bad habit gone
Just like the whiskey and the smokes
Those were tough, this is easy
Well, I'm all right, yeah, I'm okay
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

I've given you up for good
Just like I said I would
The night you walked away
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day
Yes, I've done it a thousand times a day

"
1778,Ricochet,32,Daddy's Money,1996,"

[Verse 1]
Can't concentrate on the preacher preaching
My attention span done turned off
I'm honed in on that angel singing
Up there in the choir loft

[Chorus]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination, a college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination

She's a good bass fisher, a dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

[Verse 3]
Her second cousin was my third grade teacher
I used to cut her grandma's grass
Back then she was nothin' but knees and elbows
Golly did she grow up fast

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lord if you got any miracles handy
Maybe you could grant me one
Just let me walk down the aisle and say, ""I do""
To that angel with a choir robe on

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She's got her daddy's money, her mama's good looks
And she's lookin' at me

"
1779,Rhett Akins,33,Don't Get Me Started,1996,"

Well it was January, not the fourth of July
A snow white morning, and a clear blue sky
We were miles from nowhere
But somehow another love found us
We were laughing and looking in each others hearts
Talkin' and touchin' (and) trying so hard
Not to notice what was going on all around us

CHORUS

There were fireworks flashing
Thunder Clapping
Big waves crashing on the shore
There were church bells ringing, angels singing
All gathered around heavens door
Then we kissed and I saw the light
I could go on about this all night
Hey darlin' if you don't want to hear how the waters parted
Don't get me started

Naw don't get me started I'm warning you
Unless you've got an extra week or two
You know darn well how I get when you get me goin'
Naw don't get me taking 'bout us
About the day we fell in love
Unless your longing for a dose of strong emotion

REPEAT CHORUS

"
1780,Marty Stuart & Travis Tritt,34,Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best,1996,"

Written by Marty Stuart

Well I was born for Saturday night
Looking for trouble and ready to fight
I was made to be wild and free
Where it's loud and bright, that's where I'll be
And I might change some day I guess
But honky tonkin's what I do best
I can juke all night without taking a breath
Get out on the floor, dance myself to death
I'm a wild-eyed, certified, bonafide general mess
And honky tonkin's what I do best

I never had much luck with society
My momma used to say ""he don't belong to me""
But deep down I think daddy understood
He always made me feel like I was worth some good
Sister moved to New York and she's a big success (I'm so impressed)
But honky tonkin's what I do best

I can juke all night without taking a breath
Get out on the floor, dance myself to death
I'm a wild-eyed, certified, bonafide general mess
And honky tonkin's what I do best
Honky tonkin's what I do best
Yeah, I said honky tonkin's what I do best
Honky tonkin's what I do best

"
1781,Clay Walker,35,Hypnotize The Moon,1996,"

She knew she caught my eye and that was all it took
Ain't it strange how forever changed with just one look
The magic filled the night she touched my soul like no one else
Yes the way that woman made me feel left me talkin to myself

Oh you better run for cover you better hide your heart
Cause once you start to love her you know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond when she walks into a room
She could charm the stars hypnotize the moon

Once I held her close I knew just where I stood
No you never get a second chance to ever feel so good
Then and there I knew these words are etched in stone
If you can't feel the power of the greatest love you've known

Oh you better run for cover you better hide your heart
Cause once you start to love her you know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond when she walks into a room
She could charm the stars hypnotize the moon

You better run for cover you better hide your heart
Cause once you start to love her you know you'll never stop
She shines like a diamond when she walks into a room
She could charm the stars...
She could charm the stars hypnotize the moon

"
1782,Shania Twain,36,No One Needs To Know,1996,"

[Verse 1]
Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
But no one needs to know right now

[Chorus]
I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 2]
I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

[Chorus]
I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But i'm gonna keep it a secret for now

[Verse 3]
We'll have a little girl a little boy
A little benji we call leroy
But no one needs to know right now

[Bridge]
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only only he can make it right
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only only he can make it right

[Outro]
I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

There's your record [?]
Yup, there you go dudes

1783,Martina McBride,37,Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town,1996,"

[Verse 1]
With lipstick on his collar and a trace of cheap perfume
He undresses in the darkness and eases into bed
With her face turned to the other wall
She pretends to be asleep
But it doesn't really matter
Because there's nothing to be said
He calls from work to tell her
He's sorry about last night
If he uses all the right words
She'll forgive him once again
But the phone just keeps on ringing
And he knows that something's wrong
He feels his heart start pounding
And his head begins to spin

[Chorus]
Phones are ringing all over town
North and south and east and west on main street up and down
He's got friends of his calling friends of hers
But she's nowhere to be found
Phones are ringing all over town

[Verse 2]
He calls the hospital, her sister's house and the place that does her hair
God, if something ever happened
He'd surely lose his mind
And he's thinking it's just like she's disappeared into thin air
As American flight #204 departed right on time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well he knows she'd never leave him
She's just got to be around
Phones are ringing[x2]
Phones are ringing all over town

"
1784,Lorrie Morgan & Jon Randall,38,By My Side,1996,"

There's so much breaking up
Folks who won't fall in love
Put up shells, guard themselves, build walls
And it makes me cry sometimes
'Cause people live lonely lives
They don't want to try
They don't want to live at all

Chorus: But I'm not gonna be afraid
To give up my heart that way
'Cause I need you, I need you by my side
And I'm not gonna say I'm strong
Out here in this world alone
Cause I need you, I need you by my side

And when you find someone
Someone you really love
It makes life easier to bear
But some folks live on their own
Shut themselves in at home
They never find out
What love's all about
'Cause they're scared

Repeat Chorus

Tag: 'Cause I need you I need you by my side

"
1785,Diamond Rio,39,That's What I Get For Lovin' You,1996,"

I start every day with a smile on my face
And the feel of a kiss on my lips
When the world plays to rough I can find a healin' touch
Life's never been better than this

That's what I get for lovin' you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for lovin' you

There was a time I walked outside the lines
I only thought of myself
Then you sat me down turned my head around
Now, I put you before everything else

That's what I get for lovin' you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for lovin' you

Love is a feelin' I never knew much about
Forever's a word I never said until now

That's what I get for lovin' you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for lovin' you

That's what I get for lovin' you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for lovin' you...

1786,Wade Hayes,40,On A Good Night,1996,"

On a good night I could hop in my truck
Round up my friends and with any kind of luck
We could end up howling at a harvest moon

On a good night I could put on my hat
Head down to the honky tonk and dance
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

Chorus:
Brown hair blue eyes once in a life time
Countrified kind of girl
Heart-breaking chance-taking wild little love making
Shaking up my world
Hey, on a good night I can picture the day
All my dreams come true
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

--- Instrumental ---

On a good night I can drive to the lake
Turn on the radio and find George Strait
Then go play a little game of eight ball pool

On a good night I might be found
Draggin with the boys cross town
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

Chorus:
Brown hair blue eyes once in a life time
Countrified kind of girl
Heart-breaking chance-taking wild little love making
Shaking up my world
Hey, on a good night I can picture the day
All my dreams come true
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

Chorus:
Brown hair blue eyes once in a life time
Countrified kind of girl
Heart-breaking chance-taking wild little love making
Shaking up my world

All my dreams come true
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

Yeah, on a real good night I meet a women like you...

1787,Trace Adkins,41,There's A Girl In Texas,1996,"

[Verse 1]
When I rode out of Dallas, chasin' down a dream
I thought I knew what I was lookin' for
But the neon nights have blinded me, till I'm lost in Tennessee
Not sure I know, who I am, anymore

[Chorus]
But there's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That does

[Verse 2]
You're a truly lovely lady, and you sure light up the night
I'm a lonely man, but I'm leavin' here alone
I won't try to lie to you, about this heart of mine
That I can't give, that I don't really own

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That does

[Bridge]
If this dream that I've been chasin', ever sets me free
And I wake up, to find it don't need me

[Chorus]
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas
That does

[Outro]
Yes, there's a girl in Texas
That I still love

"
1788,Linda Davis,42,A Love Story In The Making,1996,"

Jenny's got a trailer on the county line
Satellight dish working overtime
Watchin' those movies on a 30 inch screen
Dreamin' about places she's never seen

She's in the diner by five o'clock
Playin' Elvis on the old juke box
Staring out the window at nothing in sight
As she sings 'Are you lonesome tonight'

Every time some stranger walks in through that door
She can't help but wonder if he's the one shes been waiting for

It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
A sweet love story is all she needs

Bobby's got a one truck trucking line
Running double nickle tryin' to make a dime
Seven long years he's been rollin on
Wondering if he'll ever call someplace home

Lately he's been thinkin', it be kinda neat
To have someone over in the passenger seat

Another shoulder for the heavy load
Lately its' been such a lonely ol' road

Up ahead in the distance he sees a diner sign
Thinkin' its' just for the coffee, he shuts down and walks inside

It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
A sweet love story is all he needs

Over apple pie he asks for their first date
Thirty-eight states later theres a baby on the way

It's a love story in the making
Something that was meant to be
A heart patiently waiting for a little bit of destiny
Oh, a sweet love story is all they need
Is all they need

"
1789,Kenny Chesney,43,Back In My Arms Again,1996,"

[Verse 1]
People always say that hindsight's 20/20
When it comes to mistakes in love, girl I got plenty
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch crying
Living for the day I could make it all up to you

[Chorus]
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'till then
Now honey I won't' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again

[Verse 2]
Well I'm getting to know this old town like never before
Walking every street, knocking on every door
Girl, whereever you are, I want you back
I love you baby, and I'm sure 'bout that
Whatever it takes, there's nothing that I won't do

[Chorus]
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'till then
Now honey I won't' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again

[Bridge]
I must have been a fool, I confess
To ever let you go, now I ain't gonna rest

[Chorus]
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till your back in my arms, I'll be oh lonesome 'till then
Now honey I won't' eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till your back in my arms, back in my arms again

Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go I won't grieve
If you wait a lifetime
Before you leave
But if you must go I won't tell you no
Just so that we can say we tried
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

1791,Ricky Skaggs,45,Cat's In The Cradle,1996,"

A child arrived the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it
And as he grew he'd say, I'm gonna be like you dad
You know I'm gonna be like you

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, Thanks for the ball come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw? I said, Not today
I got a lot to do. He said, That's okay
He walked away but his smile never dimmed
He said, I'm gonna be like him
Yeah, you know I'm gonna be like him

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while
He shook his head and then he said with a smile
What I'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys
See you later can I have them please

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home son? I don't know when
But we'll have a good time then dad
You know we'll have a good time then

I've long since retired my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to dad if I could find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you dad
It's been sure nice talking to you

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home son? I don't know when
But we'll have a good time then dad
You know we'll have a good time then...

I appreciate your sweet kind words and girl you're looking good tonight
Had you come around not too long ago I'm sure we'd had us a time
But I got someone givin' me more love than I'll ever need
Girl you got to understand
It'd be like givin' water to a drowning man
Building a fire and the desert sand
Tellin' old Noah all about the flood
Catfish hearing bout the Mississippi mud
You want to give me lovin' and I'm sure that you can
But it's like givin' water to a drowning man
Lots of pretty women in this town but I don't give a second look
It's just a waste of time staring at the cover when you've already read the book
Cause ever since the day we met I've been in over my head
No one loves me like she can
It'd be like givin' water to a drowning man
Tellin' Merle Haggard bout a one night stand
Cussin' at the devil preachin' at the choir
Throwin' a lighted match on a raging fire
My baby gives me more love than any one man can stand
It'd be like givin' water to a drowning man

1794,Tracy Byrd,48,Heaven In My Woman's Eyes,1996,"

It's cold this time of year and the people
In this city make it colder
They've all forgotten what it means
To lend a hand or cry on a shoulder
In this land of opportunity we fight like hell
To make an extra dime
It would surely get the best of me
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born
To lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Simplicity was once a way of life
But now it's buried with our past
A dollar used to go a long long way
But now it just goes fast
Oh, how I wish that I could be
As free as our union eagle flies
But the only time I'm free is when
I view the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born
To lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Life on earth would sure be hell
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes...

1799,Tim McGraw With Faith Hill,3,It's Your Love,1997,
1800,Mindy McCready,4,A Girl's Gotta Do (What A Girl's Gotta Do),1997,"

[Verse 1]
The first thing I did when you said goodbye
Was sit myself down and have a real good cry
The next thing I did was put my red dress on
And went downtown dancin' till the break of dawn

[Chorus]
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

[Verse 2]
Fancy meetin' you at our stompin' ground
Sorry if you caught me paintin' the town
Guess I shoulda stayed home with your memory
Well, baby don't take it personally

[Chorus]
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

Gimme a call some time real soon
And remind me to remember to forget about you

"
1801,Alan Jackson,5,Who's Cheatin' Who,1997,"

[Verse 1]
Everywhere you look, you can write a book
On the trouble with a woman and a man
But you can not impose, you can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door

[Verse 2]
I thought I knew her well, I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right when she held me tight
How could I be so blind?

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door
Guitar

[Verse 3]
A heart is on the line each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along it keeps going on
As long as you keep it outta sight

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door

[Chorus]
Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
And whose car is parked next door

[Chorus]
But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who, and who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doing right with someone tonight
Whose car is parked next door

"
1802,John Michael Montgomery,6,I Miss You A Little,1997,"

Sometimes a song can touch a nerve
That takes me back to you
When I pick up my old guitar
And I play your favorite tune
Every now and then, some little thing
I've buried comes bubblin' up
And once in a while, you feel close enough to touch

I miss you a little since you've been gone
A few little memories keep hangin' on
I miss you a little, I guess you could say
A little too much, a little too often
A little more everyday

When I go by our old house
I pretend that you're still there
Waitin' for me on the porch
But there's just an empty chair
Wish I could see you one more time
Before I drive away
So I could stop and go inside, and say

I miss you a little since you've been gone
A few little memories keep hangin' on
I miss you a little, I guess you could say
A little too much, a little too often
A little more everyday

A little too much, a little too often
A little more everyday

"
1803,Kevin Sharp,7,She's Sure Taking It Well,1997,"

We decided to try
Going our own ways for a while
And give each other some space
But I never dreamed it would be miles
I thought she would cry
While she was packing up
I guess something isn't wrong enough

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well

There go all of my dreams
Melting like sugar in the rain
I would love to believe
She's only smiling through the pain
All the tears are mine
Shouldn't she be sad
After losing everything we had

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well

She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well
She's sure taking it well

"
1804,Vince Gill,8,A Little More Love,1997,"

[Verse 1:]
We both went a little crazy
We both did each other wrong
Don't think it's too late baby
Don't think that all hope is gone

[Chorus 1:]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right

[Verse 2:]
It'd be easy to say it doesn't matter
To walk away and wish you the best
But I know we'd feel a whole lot better
If we tried a little tenderness

[Chorus 2:]
We need a little more love
To get us through the night
Just a little more love
And we'll be all right
We're gonna be all right

[Verse 3:]
Let's put our differences aside
We can make it baby you and I
Let's give it just one more try
We can't let this thing die

[Chorus 1:]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3:][x2]
Oh just a little more love
Gonna be all right
Little more love
Gonna be all right

"
1805,Alabama,9,Sad Lookin' Moon,1997,"

I thought that you could fly
I thought that you had wings
I guess that I believed
You'd never say goodbye
But my world stopped turnin' 'round
The stars turned upside down
It knocked me to the ground on my knees

Now there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me
There's a sad lookin' sky
As far as I can see
I always believed
And I thought the stars could see
But there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me

I shared with you my dreams
I gave you everything
I opened up my heart
And I gave you my ring
Well I spent days and nights
Just thinkin' about the time
When you would be mine all my life

Now there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me
There's a sad lookin' sky
As far as I can see
I always believed
And I thought the stars could see
But there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me

There's a sad lookin' moon
A sad lookin' moon
There's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me

"
1806,LeAnn Rimes,10,The Light In Your Eyes,1997,"

[Verse 1]
Life can take your dreams
And turn them upside down
Friends will talk about you
When you're not around
Reality can really cut you down to size
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
People make you promises they'll never keep
Soon you'll know why people say talk is cheap
And life resembles one big compromise
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes

[Chorus]
Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself
You're a shining star
Yes, you are

[Verse 2]
Somewhere down the line
You'll face the judgment day
When the angels look at you
What will you say?
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes

[Chorus]
Keep on shining
Keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying
Just keep trying to remind yourself
You're a shining star
Yes, you are

[Outro]
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes
Don't ever lose

"
1807,Lorrie Morgan,11,Good As I Was To You,1997,"

She Drove up to the restaurant
Where they used to dine
He was sittin at the table
With someone new this time
She walked up right beside him
Her face did not turn red
She looked at him so calmly, and this is what she said:

Good as i was to you, is this the thanks i get?
Are all the years we shared, so easy to forget?
Does this mean that you've won?
Are you finally having fun?
Is she your dream come true?
Oh, she sure looks good, but she won't ever be
Good as i was to you

The room got awful quiet, Everybody stared
Finally the waiter said, ""should i bring another chair?""
She said ""no i was just leavin' ""
But as she walked out the door
She said ""honey, you can have him, I dont want him anymore.""

Good as i was to you, is this the thanks i get?
Are all the years we shared, So easy to forget?
Is the way its done, lookin out for number one?
Did you think it through?
Oh, she sure looks good, but she won't never be GOOD as i was to you

Does this mean that you've won?
Are you finally havin' fun?
Is she your dream come true?
Oh she sure looks good, but she won't ever be good as i was to you

Good as I was to you

"
1808,Tracy Lawrence,12,Better Man  Better Off,1997,"

The hardest thing I'll ever do
Is to walk away still loving you
I'd give anything if you loved me
But somethings just ain't meant to be

Can't say it's all been time lost
In the Long Run, I'll be a Better Man, Better Off

Gonna find my pride, self esteem, get on with my life
Follow my dreams, ain't' lookin back
Learn from my mistakes, once I'm past this heartache
I know when the hurting stops, I'll Be a Better Man, Better Off

I know Rome wasn't built in a day
And there's alot of good memories in my way
If I had it to do over again
I wouldn't change a thing, except for the end

Gonna be some pain, gotta pay the cost
But in the long run, I'll be a Better Man, Better Off

Gonna find my pride, self esteem, get on with my life
Follow my dreams, ain't' lookin back
Learn from my mistakes, once I'm past this heartache
I know when the hurting stops, I'll Be a Better Man, Better Off

I'm gonna learn from my mistakes
Once I'm past the heartache
I know when the hurting stops
A Better Man
A whole lot better off

"
1809,Brooks & Dunn,13,Why Would I Say Goodbye,1997,"

[Verse 1]
I guess I lost my head last night
Kept on until I made you cry
Walked out with my stubborn pride
Wasn't nothing you could do to stop me
I hit the road but I didn't get far
Just drove around all night in my car
Now I'm not sure where to start
To tell you that I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I just want to hold you
I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to leave
I just want to be with you
And after living alone, lost for so long
Finally found the love of my life
Why would I say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I don't know what is is about the edge of a cliff
Makes we want to get so close to it
I guess this time I finally slipped
What a foolish way to end it
Maybe that's why I'm back here now
Got both feet back on the ground
Hoping you won't turn me down
When I ask you for forgiveness

[Chorus]

"
1810,Sawyer Brown,14,Six Days On The Road,1997,"

Well, I pulled out of Pittsburgh, rolling down the eastern seaboard
I've got me diesel wound up and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead but it's all right, I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm passing little white lines and my eyes are open wide
Just passed a Jimmy and a White, I've been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lot of women, but I'm not like some of the guys
I could find one to hold  me tight, but I could not make believe it's right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, the ICC is checking on down the line
I'm a little overweight and my log books are way behind
But nothing bothers me tonight, I can dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

My rig's a little old, but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and the smoke's rolling black as coal
My home town's coming in sight, if you think I'm happy, you're right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

"
1811,Collin Raye,15,On The Verge,1997,"

Well they shouldn't have played that good
I got carried away and let the music go to my head
Well she shouldn't have worn that dress
The way it curled around when she was spinning
Just killed me dead

My heart had began to tell my body and my soul
That it had gotten in the mood to lose control

Chorus:
Oh, no. When did neon lights turn into moonglow
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow
I'm about to give into this urge
One more slow dance, with her arms around me
One more long glance, nothing will slow down me'
I got no chance, if i'm not in love i'm on the verge

All I wanted to be was cool
It ain't my style to overheat, much less burn
But as we floated across the floor
All at once I flashed right past the point, of no return

And when we said goodnight, the sun was on the rise
And any stars that hadn't set had fallen in my eyes

Chorus

"
1812,Reba McEntire,16,I'd Rather Ride Around With You,1997,"

[Verse 1]
My cousin's getting married at the Methodist church
That's why I stayed home from work
I'm supposed to hold the flowers
When the new bride kisses the groom
That's what I'm supposed to do
So what are we doing with the windows rolled down
Twenty five passionate miles from town
I love her like a sister baby but to tell the truth

[Chorus]
I'd rather ride around with you

[Verse 2]
The guy she's going to marry has got money to burn
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm
Yeah that's how they're going
To Hawaii on their honeymoon
First class to Honolulu
She's never even set foot on a jet
I'm a little bit jealous I confess
I'd like to fly to Hawaii
But honey, if I had to choose

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't care where this road goes
No, I don't want to turn around
Let go of the wheel, feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowing down

They're tying tin cans to the back of the car
Wondering where in the world we are
The preacher's done praying
And the couple's done saying I do
That could be me and you
There's way too many decisions to make
The length of the dress
The layers on the cake
One of these days I might get married too

[Chorus][x3]

"
1813,Ty Herndon,17,Loved Too Much,1997,"

[Verse 1]
You say you love me a little
You say you want to stay friends
You say you don't want no strings attached
No one on you to depend
You see love as a prison
I see love as a key
You think a little is more than enough
It's not that way for me

[Chorus]
I need to be loved too much
I need to be held too tight
I need to hear someone say at the end of the day
I'll make everything right
When the rest of the world goes home
I need to feel someone's touch
I've been alone too long
Now I need to be loved too much

[Verse 2]
Too much sun will burn you
Too much rain you'll drown too
Too much cold will freeze you
Too much wind will blow you down
But love is something different
That disregards the rules
You call me a dreamer
But sometimes dreams come true

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh, I need to be loved too much
Yes, I need to be loved too much

"
1814,Tanya Tucker,18,Little Things,1997,"

Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
Before you spend your money, I oughta let you know
If you wanna get to me, try the little things. Don't need that mansion on top of the hill:
Too many rooms with nothing to fill
You can furnish me, with the little things.Rub my back, make me laugh;
Hold me while I dream
All it takes, to make my day
Is to tell me you love me:
Little things.It doesn't matter what mood I'm in
I always melt when you begin
Whispering the little things.Rub my back, make me laugh;
Hold me while I dream
All it takes, to make my day
Is to tell me you love me.Rainy walks, midnight talks;
Dance me on your feet
Hold me close, don't let go
All I'll ever need.Is a single rose; a kiss hello;
That smile upon your face
The tender way, you say my name
Takes my breath away:
Little things, whoa, yeah
Ah now, Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
All I'll ever need is little things
Little things

"
1815,Deana Carter,19,Count Me In,1997,"

Could there be a different ending
To the same old story
Cause you're not the first to say
You're gonna be there for me
I need to know what's in your heart
Can you finish what you start
How can I be sure I won't be sorry

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in

When you tell me you're the one
I've always needed
You don't know how much I'm wanting
To believe it
But I've heard it all before
Now I'm needing something more
A promise is no good if you can't keep it

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in

You can count me in

"
1816,Mark Chesnutt,20,Let It Rain,1997,"

[Verse 1]
Storm clouds rising, flash of lightning
Rattles that ole porch swing
Window open, curtains dancing
Just you and me
As the thunder rolls on, we'll just hold on
'Neath the light of this candle flame
Oh, this is perfect, what a night
Let it rain

[Chorus]
Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain

[Verse 2]
Old man weather had it together
When he planned this night
From out of the blue, he set the mood
Turned out the lights
Just when we thought the storm was over
Here it comes again
So, lay back down in these arms
Let it rain

[Chorus]
Let your love pour down all around
Let it fill my heart, let it flood this house
Let the world outside just wash on by
We'll just lay right here and hold on tight
Let it rain
Let it rain

"
1817,Mark Wills,21,Places I've Never Been,1997,"

I've never seen the sun set at Montigo Bay
But my heart melts when you look at me that way
And I've never seen the snow fall
From a rocky mountain sky
But I get a chill just by lookin' in your eyes

Chorus:
'Cause you take me places I've never been
I travel the world in your arms and back again
I have no need to wander or go chasing those four winds
'Cause you take me places I've never been

I may never see the wonders of this earth
I may never hold treasures of great worth
I could search the whole world over
But I don't have to go that far
I've got it all right her in my arms

Chorus:
'Cause you take me places I've never been
I travel the world in your arms and back again
I have no need to wander or go chasing those four winds
'Cause you take me places I've never been

'Cause you take me places. I've never been...

1818,Pam Tillis,22,All The Good Ones Are Gone,1997,"

[Verse 1]
She'll turn thirty-four this weekend
She'll go out with her girlfriends
They'll drink some margaritas, cut up and carry on
There'll be guys and there'll be come-ons
She'll probably get hit on
But she thinks all the good ones are gone

[Verse 2]
She's got friends down at the office
And she can't help but notice
That when the day is over, how they all hurry home
Every day there's guys she works with
And even some she flirts with
But it seems like all the good ones are gone

[Chorus]
And her momma called this morning
Said I'm worried about my baby
I wish you had a family of your own
She said Mom it's not that easy
You make it sound so simple
She can't take the first man that comes along

[Verse 3]
Once she had someone who loved her
Back when she was younger
Now she wonders if she held out a little bit too long
Back then there were so many
But now there just aren't any
It seems like all the good ones are gone

[Chorus]
And her momma called this morning
Said I'm worried about my baby
I wish you had a family of your own
She said Mom it's not that easy
You make it sound so simple
She can't take the first man that comes along

[Tag]
She'll turn thirty-four this weekend
She'll go out with her girlfriends
They'll drink some margaritas, cut up and carry on
Oooh

"
1819,Lee Ann Womack,23,Never Again  Again,1997,"

Never again, again
Once more I'll let you back in
I know how the story ends
But I can't help myself
You'll break my heart I know
Through my tears I watch you go
Then just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again

Each time you leave
I say I've had enough
But I must be addicted
To your kind of love
I swear to myself
I'm gonna stand my ground
But one look at you
Breaks my defenses down

And here comes never again, again
Once more I'll let you back in
And just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again

And just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again

"
1820,Trace Adkins,24,I Left Something Turned On At Home,1997,"

[Verse 1]
Well boys I hate to leave good company
But my baby just called me on the phone
From the sound of her voice, I simply have no choice
I left somethin' turned on at home

[Verse 2]
Well I just put a quarter in the jukebox
And it ain't halfway through my favorite song
But if I don't leave right now, my whole place might burn down
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Chorus]
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Verse 3]
Hey waitress could you cancel that order
But if it's too late I'll take it to go
Boys I gotta run, 'fore somebody calls 911
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Chorus]
It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home

[Outro]
Right now her arms are open
The house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left somethin' turned on at home
Yeah I left somethin' turned on at home

"
1821,Sons Of The Desert,25,Whatever Comes First,1997,"

Everyone says it's no big deal
Nothin' a little more time won't heal
Sooner or later the way I fell will change
But they never hurt the way I do
'Cause they never had to get over you
So they never shared my point of view of the pain

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first

There's only so much a man can take
Before his reality starts to break
Especially holdin' an old heartache like you
Somebody's leavin' I don't care who
But there's not enough room in my mind for two
It's finally come down to me or you

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'd do anything, go anywhere
Show me some way out and girl I'm there
It's gotten to the point where I don't care
Blessing or curse
I'll take whatever comes first

"
1822,Rick Trevino,26,I Only Get This Way With You,1997,"

I only feel like i feel with you and nobody else
And i only want to be with you and be myself
But when i look in your eyes something happens to
Me everytime and i can't seem to find what to say to you

(chorus)
I only get this way with you
I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you
And when were together i feel like i never ever felt before
As if im walking thru that door to love a love like i never knew
I only get this way with you

I want u to know how i feel when im holding u in my arms
And i want u to know how i miss u when were apart
But when i look in ur eyes something happens to me everytime
And i can't seem to find what to say to you

(chorus)
I only get this way with you
I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you
And when were together i feel like i never ever felt before
As if im walking thru that door to love a love like i never knew
I only get this way with you

Then i think about all the times i've known
What i thought was love it was never this strong

I only feel this way with you
And when were together i feel like i never ever felt before
As if im walking thru that door to love a love like i never knew
I only get this way with u

I only get this way with you
I only feel this way with you

1823,Clay Walker,27,Rumor Has It,1997,"

Darlin' you know its true
The rumor you heard about me loving you
Well I never told a soul so
Tell me how the whole world knows

It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor has it
You love me too

Well I've got a ring and a plan
But I see your on to what to what im gonna ask
Well i never said a thing
Tell me what gave it away

It must have been the roses and the wine
Or maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor has it
You love me too

It Must have been the roses and the wine
Or Maybe this unexplainable smile
They say where there's smoke there's fire
Well I hope its true
Cause rumor Has It

It must have been the roses and the wine

Well i hope its true
Cause rumor has it
You love me too

Yes you do
I heard it too

"
1824,Patty Loveless,28,The Trouble With The Truth,1997,"

Oh the trouble with the truth
Is it's always the same ol' thing
So hard to forget, so impossible for me to change
Everytime I try to fight it
I know I'll be left to blame
Oh the trouble with the truth
Is it's always the same ol' thing

And the trouble with the truth
Is it's just what I need to hear
Ringing so right, deep down inside my ear
And it's everything I want
And it's everything I fear
Oh the trouble with the truth
Is it's just what I need to hear

It had ruined the taste of the sweetest lies
Burned through my best alibis
Every sin that I deny
Keeps hanging round my door
Oh the trouble with the truth
Is it always begs for more
That's the trouble, trouble with the truth
That's the trouble, trouble with the truth

And the trouble with the truth
Is it just won't let me rest
I run and hide, but there's always another test
And I know that it won't let me be
'Till I've given it my best
The trouble with the truth
Is it just won't let me rest

That's the trouble, trouble with the truth
That's the trouble, trouble with the truth
That's the trouble, trouble with the truth
That's the trouble, trouble with the truth

"
1825,Trace Adkins,29,(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing,1997,"

[Verse 1]
I been thinkin' about our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense

[Chorus]
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme, or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't, no thinkin' thing

[Verse 2]
Forget mathematical equations
Self-help psychology
Gray matter don't matter much darlin'
When it's gettin' down to you and me, oh

[Chorus]
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme, or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't, no thinkin' thing

[Outro]
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't, no thinkin' thing
This ain't, no this ain't, no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing, girl, no
No this ain't no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing
Ain't no thinkin' thing, girl
This ain't no thinkin' thing, baby
This ain't this ain't this ain't. no thinkin' thing
This ain't no thinkin' thing

"
1826,David Kersh,30,Another You,1997,"

Yesterday morning just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
And I stopped and stared
I could almost see you standing there
Don't get me wrong I'm almost over you
But now and then I like to go walking through
Some of our old times
Even though I realize

That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

Night after night I go back through the years
I sit on this porch as the sun disappears
Like we did back then
And I remind myself once again

That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

I guess I should thank you
For showing me how love should feel
I know what I'm gonna look for
'Cause I felt it when you held me

And I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you

Another you

1827,Travis Tritt,31,She's Going Home With Me,1997,"

(Travis Tritt)

Well, I guess you'd call me trouble
I have been most my life
Been black and blue a time or two
'Cause I ain't scared to fight
But I got myself a sweetheart
That stands right by my side
Always around to cool me down
When I get dixie fried

And I know she loves to party
She knows I don't like crowds
But I compromise on Friday nights
And we go paint the town
She turns heads in every club
We hang out in 'til three
But I don't care how much they stare
She's going home with me

She's going home with me tonight
On that you can depend
She's not just some one night stand
That girl's is my best friend
And I don't have to be jealous
Just wait around and see
She don't want nobody else
She's going home with me

--- Instrumental ---

Well, I used to go out prowlin'
Skirt chasing every night
Sniffing 'round like some ol' hound
Like all you other guys
Until from out of nowhere
She took me by the hand
I found what I'd been looking for
Dog days came to an end

So listen good now fellas
No need to act the fool
I treat her well, no way in hell
That she'd leave me for you
Your come on lines won't sway her
She's happy as can be
She made her choice, forget it boys
She's going home with me

She's going home with me tonight
On that you can depend
She's not just some one night stand
That girl's is my best friend
And I don't have to be jealous
Just wait around and see
She don't want nobody else
She's going home with me

I don't have to get jealous
Just wait around and see
She made her choice, forget it boys
She's going home with me...

1828,Joe Diffie,32,This Is Your Brain,1997,"

This is your brain makin' everything make sense
Countin' those nickels and dimes
This is your brain balancin' on the fence, walkin' that logical line
This is your brain got it all under control, both hands on the wheel
Stay in your lane, keepin' it tame, this is your brain

Then she walks right by and that all goes out the window
And your IQ starts to dwindle, at the mention of her name
And she winks and smiles and your heart starts over loadin'
And you're crazy over everything she does
You ain't insane, this is your brain, on love

This is your brain buddy you can handle this
Gotta just get a grip
This is your brain man there ain't a woman alive
That you can't resist
This is your brain baby, just slow on down
Don't want to jump the tracks
You can refrain, keep it contained, this is your brain

Then she walks right by and that all goes out the window
And your IQ starts to dwindle, at the mention of her name
And she winks and smiles and your heart starts over loadin'
And you're crazy over everything she does
You ain't insane, this is your brain, on love

You think that you're too clever now, to ever fall again
And your medulla oblongata says, boy get out while you can

Then she walks right by and that all goes out the window
And your IQ starts to dwindle, at the mention of her name
And she winks and smiles and your heart starts over loadin'
And you're crazy over everything she does
You ain't insane, this is your brain, on love

You ain't insane, this is your brain on love
Sweet love

1829,Tracy Byrd,33,Don't Take Her She's All I Got,1997,"

Well, I said friend
Don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend
Don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I want to live
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need a drink
She's the first thought in my mind
Each time I try to think

Let me tell you now friend
Don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend
Don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She's my fingers when I want to feel
She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
She is love she's all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in wintertime
And make a flower grow

Let me tell you now friend
Don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend
Don't take her she's all I've got

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes
You're livin' a troubled life
And you've been hurtin' more and more these days
You don't have to hide it
Don't even have to fight it
Baby all you have to do is just turn and walk away

[Chorus]
When you're tired of it all
And tears need to fall
Your back's to the wall
Come cryin' to me
You don't have to be strong
You don't have to hold on
You've been there too long
Come cryin' to me
I'll leave the living room light
Burning all night
No don't even pack
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me

[Verse 2]
You can get beyond this
All those empty promises
They don't have to hold you down no more
Nothin' to explain to me
You don't even need a key
All you gotta do is knock and I'll unlock the door

[Chorus]
When you're tired of it all
And tears need to fall
Your back's to the wall
Come cryin' to me
You don't have to be strong
You don't have to hold on
You've been there too long
Come cryin' to me
I'll leave the living room light
Burning all night
No don't even pack
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me
I'll leave the living room light
Burning all night
No don't even pack
Don't even look back
Baby come cryin' to me
Baby come cryin' to me
Baby come cryin' to me

1831,John Berry,35,I Will  If You Will,1997,"

(John Jarvis/Randy Goodrum)

Once upon a time
People fell in love & they stayed in love
It never crossed their mind
Not to see it through when they said I do
This modern world changes so fast
Hearts break apart like they're made out of glass
It's getting hard to believe in love that can last
I will if you will

Once in every life
Someone comes along like you've come along
And it would be so nice
If this happiness could go on and on
But in this modern world troubles come by
People let go the first tear they cry
Someone has to be strong to keep love alive
I will if you will

But in this modern world troubles come by
People let go the first tear they cry
Someone has to be strong for love to survive
I will if you will
Lert's give it a try
Let's do it or die
I will if you will

1832,Clay Walker,36,One  Two  I Love You,1997,"

(Bucky Jone/Ed Hill)

Kindergarten, five years old
You and me and mother goose
Learning lines to nursery rhymes
That's when I feel in love with you

Back when it was
One, two buckle my shoe
Three Four shut the door
Five Six pick up sticks
Even then my heart was yours

College days miles apart
So afraid you'd forgot
Writing letters every day
And ending every one like this

One two I miss you
Three Four I walk the floor
Five Six come back quick
I don't wanna miss you no more

A little girl and little boy
Playing on a swing in the yard
As we watch I hold your hand
And you're still holding onto my heart

And now it's
One two I love you
Three four lets have one more
Five six I wouldn't miss
A day of this for all the treasure on the ocean floor

One two I love you
Three four let's shut the door
Five six, kiss after kiss
I can't wait to hold you once more

If the river is high, I'll be your shore
If it's love you need, I'll give you more
You can count on me, baby, that's for sure
I belong to you
If you cross the line, I'll cross it too
Anywhere you go I'll be with you
We'll cry some tears, but we'll make it through
As long as we're together

[Chorus]
Everything in my heart, I'll give you
Everything in my soul, it's yours
Everything that I am and will ever be
Take it from me, take it from me
Take everything

I'll give you all that you can take
I made a promise, it will never break
You've got my heart, make no mistake
Just take it from me

Everything in my heart, I'll give you
Everything in my soul, it's yours
Everything that I am and will ever be

1835,James Bonamy,39,The Swing,1997,"

In my daddy's yard
There's a worn out wooden swing
So I asked him once
What's the story with that thing
He said ""That ring of gold, that's on your momma's hand""
""Well son this is where it all began ""

This swing hung from the tree
Where the girl asked the boy will you play with me
And the sun shined bright and the world spun round
And they grew up till it all came down
From the church where they stood and said ""I Do""
Where the bells rang out and the love was true
And it grew in the hearts of the man and the woman
Who lived in the house that love built

When I'm with the girl
That stole my heart away
Well I gave that ole' swing
A brand new coat of paint
And I told the tale as we swung ""to and fro""
And I said I hope this is how our story goes

This swing hung from the tree
Where the girl asked the boy will you play with me
And the sun shined bright and the world spun round
And they grew up till it all came down
From the church where they stood and said ""I Do""
Where the bells rang out and the love was true
And it grew in the hearts of the man and the woman
Who lived in the house that love built

1836,Sammy Kershaw,40,Fit To Be Tied Down,1997,"

This ain't hoops, this ain't hopscotch
And this ain't dodge ball in the sandlot
And this ain't cards
It's our hearts we're dealing with now
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied down

I've lost at love, got some bruises
But the heart that don't give up
Never really loses
Since I met you
It don't make sense to keep on playing around
Anyone can see you've got me
Fit to be tied down

Tie me down, wrap me up in forever
I've found something sweet in surrendering now
Take me off this merry go round
Going round in circles has got me nowhere
But a love like yours is really so rare
And I'm amazed at the treasure I've finally found
I'm on bended knee
'Cause I'm fit to be tied down

Tie me down, wrap me up in forever
I've found something sweet in surrendering now
Take me off this merry go round

This ain't hoops, this ain't hopscotch
And this ain't dodge ball in the sandlot
And this ain't cards
It's our hearts we're dealing with now
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied down
No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied

I heard you've been feelin' down
Nobody's seen you around
They say that she can't be found (now what'll you do)
(Well) you're right where I've been before
So close to love's open door
Hopin' for so much more
Only to face the bitter truth

No matter what you promise, no matter what you say
You can say I love you till you're blue in the face
But tears are gonna fall if she don't love you
Oh you can buy her diamonds, shower her with pearls
Promise her forever, offer her the world
She's never gonna stay if she don't love you

I know how it feels inside
When you can't turn the tide
No matter how hard you try you're gonna hurt

I've always heard it told
Love's worth its weight in gold
And it can't be bought or sold
One of those things we never learn

No matter what you promise, no matter what you say
You can say I love you till you're blue in the face
But tears are gonna fall if she don't love you
Oh you can buy her diamonds, shower her with pearls
Promise her forever, offer her the world
She's never gonna stay if she don't love you

1839,Ricochet,43,He Left A Lot To Be Desired,1997,"

He left a letter for you by the door
Just saying ""Goodbye, I don't love you no more""
He made you feel like you weren't worth anything
But if you were mine girl I'd have everything

Chorus:
Your touch, your kiss, your tenderness
Your blue eyes burning with fire
Your heart and soul when he let them go
He left a lot to be desired
What was he thinkin' was he out of his mind
How could he walk away how could he be so blind
No I'll never understand why he gave you up
He was one lucky man when he had your love
Repeat Chorus
He left a lot to be desired

1840,Tracy Byrd,44,Don't Love Make A Diamond Shine,1997,"

Tommy and Janey barely eighteen
Holding hands at the jewelry store
Eyes open wide staring inside
At the ring that they wanted for her

Mister bring it closer mister can we hold it
I think it's gonna fit just fine
As he slipped it on her hand Janey kissed her man
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love

A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt
If the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine

There's a rich lady with a new Mercedes
Livin' up in a high rise
She's got a big ol' rock on her left hand
That looks cheaper than a Cracker Jack prize

'Cause her man don't know that it ain't the dough
No all he needs to spend is time
And that big marquis'd be a laser beam
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love

A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt
If the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine

Don't love make a diamond shine
It don't matter if it costs a dime
Dang thing looks like a million bucks
Sittin' on the hand of a girl in love

A perfect fifteen carat is duller than dirt
If the heart don't wear it
With three little words it'll knock you blind
Don't love make a diamond shine

Got a sack full of old lottery tickets
I guess I oughta throw 'em away
I threw a lot of money at the race track ponies
But I never even won one race
And you say every chain letter you ever got
You passed right along to your friends
Still all you ever got was a chain of bad luck
That you swore you thught was never gonna end
Well honey all the good fortune that was passin' us by
Sure came back around when your eyes met mine
Lucky me lucky you
We finally fell into something so strong and true
Lucky me lucky you
I thank my lucky stars and the good Lord too
I remember sittin' down with the gypsy woman
She took a close look at my hand
She said son I can see a lot of love in your life
Someday you're gonna understand
You say you threw a lot of change down that wishin' well
But it never really changed a thing
Well honey all of those pennies are payin' off now
I'm buyin' you a diamond ring
Lucky me lucky you...

[Verse 1]
He asked her to dance three songs ago
Now she pulls him closer as the music slows
The lights are growing dim it's just her and him and the band
Funny, I used to love this song
I though it was our song but I guess I was wrong
From where I'm sittin' I can see where I stand

[Chorus]
From where I'm sitting I can see where I stand
She's got her head on his shoulder and her heart in his hands
Thing's are pretty clear when a fool understands
Lord, from where I'm sitting I can see where I stand

[Verse 2]
I've never seen her dance like that before
Don't think I can take much of this anymore
He's no longer the stranger and it looks like I am
I always dreamed I'd see that look in her eyes
But I never dreamed it would be for some other guy
And from where I'm sittin' I can see where I stand

1843,Kathy Mattea,47,455 Rocket,1997,"

Mr. Smith had an Oldsmobile
Baby blue with them wire wheels
I took her home the day that she was advertised
He said she leaked when it would rain
Sounded like an aeroplane
But I knew she was jewel in disguise

She had a 455 rocket
The biggest block alive
Couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket
She was made to burn

Well, whose junk pile piece of Chevelle is this?
You boys come here to race or just kiss?
Mmm now don't ya want to know what I got underneath my hood?
I know she might sound like she's missin'
But buddy, she could teach you a lesson
In just a quarter mile, and I'll smoke you good

In my 455 rocket
The kind the police drive
I couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket
She was made to burn

I'm telling you and I ain't ashamed
I cried when that wrecker came
As we skid I thought I heard the angels sing
Sounded like the Beach Boys
We hit the curb and began to sail
Took out most of the safety rail
Even the cop asked me, ""Man what'd you have in that thing?""

I had a 455 rocket
The very kind you drive
You oughta watch yourself when you take that turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket, she was made to burn, burn
Ohh she's a rocket, she was made to burn

Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me

It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me

It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone

(Kerry Kurt Phillips/Chuck Leonard)

I've looked high and I've looked low
Talked to every old friend that she used to know
I couldn't figure out why she couldn't be found
There's only one lime green mustang in this cotton-pickin' town
I've been a fool, there's no doubt
But I think this fool's finally figured it out

She's somewhere in love with some lucky guy
She ain't missing me, I'm out of her life
I never dreamed losing that girl would ever hurt so much
She's somewhere in love, you can bet on that
She's got it good, now I've got it bad
I'm here all alone
She's somewhere in love

Close my eyes, but I can't sleep
Two silhouettes are all I see
It's funny how hindsight makes your eyes red
What's breaking my heart are the thoughts in my head
If I could talk to her now I'd get down on my knees
I know where she is but she can't be reached

She's somewhere in love with some lucky guy
She ain't missing me, I'm out of her life
I never dreamed losing that girl would ever hurt so much
She's somewhere in love, you can bet on that
She's got it good, now I've got it bad
I'm here all alone
She's somewhere in love

She's somewhere in love, you can bet on that
She's got it good, now I've got it bad
I'm here all alone
And she's somewhere in love

It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me, baby (The way you love me, baby)
It's the way you love me darling, yeah

[Outro]
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion

"
1848,Steve Wariner,2,Holes In The Floor Of Heaven,1998,"

One day shy of eight years old
When grandma passed away
I was a broken-hearted little boy
Blowing out that birthday cake

How I cried when the sky let go
With the cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said don't be sad child
Grandma's watching you today

'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
Just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me

Seasons come and seasons go
Nothing stays the same
I grew up, fell in love
Met a girl who took my name

Year by year we made a life
In this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together
Lord I sure do miss her now

But there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how I know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me

Well my little girl is 23
I walk her down the aisle
It's a shame her mom can't be here now
To see her lovely smile

They throw the rice, I catch her eye
As the rain starts comin' down
She takes my hand and says Daddy don't be sad
'Cause I know Momma's watchin' now

And there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
Yes there's holes in the floor of heaven and she's
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me

"
1849,Tracy Byrd,3,I'm From The Country,1998,"

[Verse 1]
Way back up in the country, back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Livin' with the crazzies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
That's where I'm from and I'm proud to say
I'm from the country and I like it that way

[Chorus]
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes, come on in
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way

[Verse 2]
All day long we work in the fields
Then bring it on home to a home cooked meal
We love ya like Sunday, treat ya like Saturday night
And when the beds get full we can sleep in the hay (Hey)
We're from the country and we like it that way

[Chorus]
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way

Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country
We're from the country
We're from the country
And we like it that way

"
1850,George Strait,4,I Just Want To Dance With You,1998,"

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 2]
I gotta feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
I just want to dance with you

[Chorus]
I want to dance with you, twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you, hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 3]
I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 4]
Oh the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I and so are you
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue
I just want to dance with you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you

"
1851,Tim McGraw,5,One Of These Days,1998,"

[Verse 1]
We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

[Pre-Chorus]
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

[Verse 2]
Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

[Bridge]
Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

[Chorus]
One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me

"
1852,Randy Travis,6,Out Of My Bones,1998,"

I'm in need of a remedy To cure me from loving you
It may sound a little extreme I'll do what I have to do

Chorus:
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones

Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me

"
1853,Mark Wills,7,I Do [Cherish You],1998,"

All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel,all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going
'til that day, I found you
How you opened my life to a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart until my dying day

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
Yes, I do

If you're asking do I love you this much
I do, oh, I do

[Verse 1:Reba McEntire]
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes is hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus 1:Reba McEntire]
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

[Chorus:Reba McEntire]
If you see him
Oh, if you see him

[Verse 2:Ronnie Dunn]
If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time

Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

[Chorus:Ronnie Dunn]
If you see her
If you see her

Oh, I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go

Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

Say I'll still be here

1855,LeAnn Rimes,9,Commitment,1998,"

[Verse 1]
What I'm lookin' for
Is a love that's forever
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat
And stay for all time
What I'm prayin' for
Is a match made in Heaven
Someone who will worship my body
And still put his heart on the line

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

[Verse 2]
What I'm searching for
Is a man who'll stand by me
Who will walk through the fire
And be my flame in the night
I won't settle for less
Than what I deserve
A friend and a lover who'll love me
For the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

[Bridge]
Yeah, I've had promises broken
Three words left unspoken
They just left me achin' for more
But I've found temptation
I won't be impatient
There's one thing that's worth waitin' for

[Chorus]
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

1856,Garth Brooks,10,Two Pina Coladas,1998,"

[Verse 1]
I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town

[Chorus]
So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home

[Chorus]
So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, we'll never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

[Chorus]
Bring... bring... bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
And say hello to her good timin' man

[Outro]
Bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
And we will never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand...

1857,Kenny Chesney,11,That's Why I'm Here,1998,"

[Verse 1]
Well I ain't had nothin' to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I'd drop by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the ""Y""

[Verse 2]
They started talking' about steps you take
Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the price you pay
I almost walked away

[Verse 3]
You could hear a pin drop
When this old man
Stood up and said I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Verse 4]
This old boy stood up in the isle
Said he'd been living' a life of denial
Then he cried, as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden, it was clear

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Bridge]
I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Outro]
OOH, I've been there
That's why I'm here

"
1858,Clint Black,12,The Shoes You're Wearing,1998,"

We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always something in between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still no slate is clean
For better or worse, anybody can

Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's faring
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearing
The shoes he's wearing
They don't make the man

So many people out running around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinking there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be looking for ways
To keep on seeing our better days
We're not chained to what we know
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be

Upright no matter how you're faring
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They don't make the man
But if you can't walk through the best of times
And the worst of times
Find your feet still walking the line
You'll never carry the load worth bearing

No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They won't make the man
The shoes you're wearing
They won't make the man

"
1859,Jo Dee Messina,13,Bye Bye,1998,"

[Verse 1]
Boy, you sure look good there standin' in the doorway in the sunset light
Maybe I read you wrong thinkin' you could be my ""Mr. Right""
I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line
Said you needed some time, just a little more time to make up your mind
Well, it's been long enough
Time is up

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

[Verse 2]
Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before
You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on Highway 4
Baby, what did you expect me to do?
Just sit around and wait on you?
Well, I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
And I know it sounds trite
I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

[Bridge]
I've lost the game, I guess
I did my best to win the part
Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back
You can count on that
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye, bye-bye

[Outro]
Bye-bye
Ooh, baby
Ohhh
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

1860,Gary Allan,14,It Would Be You,1998,"

[Verse 1 - Gary Allan]
It's hard describing a heartache
All because it's a one of a kind of thing
A serious injury
And a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm
I'd compare to a hurricane
Oh it's even got a name

[Chorus - Gary Allan]
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

[Verse 2 - Gary Allan]
If it was a full moon
It would be a total eclipse
If it was a tidal wave
It would sink a thousand ships
If it was a blizzard
It would be a record breaking cold
If it was a lie
It would be the biggest story you've ever told

[Chorus - Gary Allan]
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

Your hearts been broken, you don't wanna
Open up to me
But can't you see
All that you're needing is someone to believe in you
And when you are no longer afraid
Darlin' I'll be just one word away

[Chorus]
Say when, I'll be there by your side
For a day, for a year, for the rest of my life
I know you're not ready
But someday your heart's gonna mend
I'll give you love without end
Say when

[Verse 2]
Could be tomorrow, maybe a little farther
Down the road
Your heart will know
My love is timeless, and you're gonna find it's true
And no matter how long it takes
If it means holding you, I can wait

[Chorus]
Say when, I'll be there by your side
For a day, for a year, for the rest of my life
I know you're not ready
But someday your heart's gonna mend
I'll give you love without end
Say when
I know you're not ready
But someday your heart's gonna mend
I'll give you love without end
Say when

1862,Michael Peterson,16,Too Good To Be True,1998,"

(Michael Peterson/Gene Pistilli)

You were all she ever wanted, that was once upon a time
She was all you ever needed, that's what makes it such a crime
How you took her heart for granted, how you threw her love away
Now you still don't understand it, if you did, you'd never say

It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

Just because she never said so, doesn't mean she didn't see
Every time you stole an apple off somebody else's tree
Late last night that lipstick letter she left on the bedroom door
Said ""You don't get it, and you ain't gonna get it anymore!""

It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?

What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

Here we go!
It was too good to be true
What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you
Oh just too good to be true to you

1863,Toby Keith,17,Dream Walkin',1998,"

[Verse 1]
She left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle
On a table beside my bed
With a short little note that said I had a good time
It was written in lipstick red
She didn't sign her name I wonder
If that's a little secret that she keeps
Ooh, she's walking around in my sleep

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

[Verse 2]
She took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
And she never even bothered to ask
You could say I haven't seen her since late last summer
But every night she comes back
Just like smoke through the keyhole
She slips in so silently
Ooh, she's walking around in my sleep

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

[Bridge]
Oh, there's a thin line between dreams and memories
I'll be losing my mind till she comes back to me

[Chorus]
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'
She's calling my name again
Day's breaking, I ain't waking up, I'm sleeping in
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends

She's walking around in my sleep
She's walking around in my sleep

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love

Mmm, yeah
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby

1865,Terri Clark,19,Now That I Found You,1998,"

How can I believe
That my heart would find someone like you
You see me, the real me
No in bewteens, I had nowhere to hide
You took away the walls around me
Made me feel safe to share my truth

I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

I do believe we're meant to be
Our chemistry will last forever
And through the years
We'll see some tears
We'll conquer fears
And together we will grow
Looking in your eyes
They tell me
I no longer have to feel alone

I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

You see me, the real me
You believe in me

I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you...

1866,Mark Chesnutt,20,I Might Even Quit Lovin' You,1998,"

Ever since you told me we were through
I've been down, I've been down
The love you said I'd find to take your place
Never came around, never came around
But one of these days I'll stand on my own
And I'll turn this bleeding heart into stone

Gonna reach way down inside and find a brand new will to live
Got plans to forget about the way you made me feel
Gonna walk outside one night and turn your memory loose
And when I do, I might even quit lovin' you
And when I do, I might even quit lovin' you

There was time I thought I knew for certain
You'd come home, you'd come home
But judging from the nights I've spent without you
I was wrong, I was wrong
The time has finally come to face the truth
There's only one thing left I can do

Gonna reach way down inside and find a brand new will to live
Got plans to forget about the way you made me feel
Gonna walk outside one night and turn your memory loose
And when I do, I might even quit lovin' you
Yeah when I do, I might even quit lovin' you

(When I do, I might even quit lovin' you.)
(When I do, I might even quit lovin' you.)..

"
1867,Ty Herndon,21,A Man Holdin' On (To A Woman Lettin' Go),1998,"

[Verse 1]
Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
A man holding on to a woman letting go

[Verse 2]
There's a man with a bottle on the other side of town
Swimming with a memory that he can't drown
Lord, it ain't sunk in that she ain't coming home
Oh, a man holding on to a woman letting go

[Chorus]
His heart is telling him
To hang on for dear life
'Cause deep down he knows
She's letting go for good this time

[Verse 3]
There's a daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
Fighting back tears and forcing a smile
Oh, for twenty-two years he's watched her grow
A man holding on to a woman letting go

[Verse 4]
In the Hill Valley Home, there's a feeble old man
And he's holding on to a fragile old hand
And the angels are coming to carry her home
Now he's a man holding on to a woman letting go

[Chorus]
His heart is telling him
To hang on for dear life
'Cause deep down he knows
She's letting go for good this time

[Outro]
Two young lovers with their bodies on fire
Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
Oh, a man holding on to a woman letting go
A man holding on to a woman, a woman letting go

"
1868,Sammy Kershaw,22,Matches,1998,"

We meet at the Broken Spoke Restaurant and Lounge
I lit your cigarette then you wrote your number down
On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs
I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

Chorus
You took the bed; you took the dishes and the car
And you broke my trust and you took advantage of my heart
And you left me here with empty rooms and walls with holes, scars and scratches
If I find the strength to burn your memory down
At least you left the matches

The color is old and faded; the cover's worn and stained
I can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
They all thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're all out in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

Chorus
You took the bed; you took the dishes and the car
And you broke my trust and you took advantage of my heart
And you left me here with empty rooms of walls and holes, scars and scratches
Now I found the strength to burn your memory down
At least you left the matches

Baby all that's left of our love now is ashes
Thank god you left the matches

"
1869,Joe Diffie,23,Texas Size Heartache,1998,"

A little Miss Dynamite just blew my world away
It was a pitiful sight, me begging her to stay
I never had a hunch, so how was I to know
That she packed a punch that knocked my heart out cold?

She put a hurtin' on this old cowboy
Broke my heart like a little play toy
Brought me to my knees from ten feet tall
The night she left me in Amarillo
I cried crocodile tears in my pillow
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas size heartache on me?

She came across so cool I didn't think that I'd get burned
Now I'm a big ol' fool with a leaving lesson learned
I thought I was strong like old Hercules
But she proved me wrong with her little c'est la vie!

She put a hurtin' on this old cowboy
Broke my heart like a little play toy
Brought me to my knees from ten feet tall
The night she left me in Amarillo
I cried crocodile tears in my pillow
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas size heartache on me?

How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas size heartache on me?

1870,Collin Raye,24,I Can Still Feel You,1998,"

[Verse 1]
It's that feeling
That someone
Is standing behind me
And I turn around and there's no one there

[Verse 2]
And it's the sensation
That someone
Just whispered
I still hear your voice but you're not really here

[Pre-Chorus]
Your memory is like a ghost
And my heart is its host

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Verse 3]
You said you'd love me
Forever
Then you said
It's over
And left me without the missing link

[Verse 4]
I thought I'd
Forget you
But I guess I
Forgot to
And lately I've been too confused to think

[Pre-Chorus]
When I reach for someone new
It's like I'm touching you!

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Pre-Chorus]
In everything that moves
And everything I do!

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Outro]
Ohhhhhh, I can still feel you! (still feel you)
Yeah!

1871,Dixie Chicks,25,There's Your Trouble,1998,"

[Verse 1]
It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, ""Dear John,"" and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble

"
1872,Clay Walker,26,Then What?,1998,"

Well I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said I know what's on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass ain't always greener on the other side

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what

Well I ain't saying that looking's a crime
Well I've done my share from time to time
It dont mean that you gotta take that leap
When you're standin' on the brink
Before you jump you gotta step back and think
There's price for ever promise you dont keep

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what

Do want you want, do want you wish
It's your life but remember this
There's bound to be some consequences
Sneaking under other fences

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what

1873,Keith Harling,27,Papa Bear,1998,
1874,Trisha Yearwood,28,There Goes My Baby,1998,"

He was the kind of guy who loved so unselfishly
And everyone could see what a prize he was
Everyone but me
I must be blind
I must be the kind who don't know what they have
'Til they're all alone and sad

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye

How could I have a love so fine
And not know what it's worth
Maybe this empty heart he left behind
Is all that I deserve
What kind of fool
Finds a perfect jewel and can't see how it shines
'Til she's all alone and cryin'

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye

How I wish I could hold him in my arms and say
This time I'm gonna treat him right
But it's too late

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye
Bye bye baby goodbye
Bye bye baby goodbye

1875,Clint Black,29,Nothin' But The Taillights,1998,"

[Verse 1]
Blue Kentucky highway
Headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night but the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

[Chorus]
Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

[Verse 2]
Was it somethin' that I did to her
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were
Was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parkin' spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck

[Chorus]
Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind

[Bridge]
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' at how
She brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

[Chorus]
She'll be walkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights she won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely as a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

[Outro]
There she goes
And here I come
Leave me out there in the middle of nowhere
Drive this

1876,Trisha Yearwood,30,Perfect Love,1998,"

[Verse 1]
Sunday mornin' when the paper comes
Let's read it front to back and see what's going on
Drink our coffee by the flower bed and talk about the stuff
That's running through our heads
When you look at me the way you do
I can't help but look right back at you

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me
In a perfect love

[Verse 2]
Hey, let's drive to the edge of town
See what there is to see and then turn back around
Stop by and see your mom and dad
And hear 'em talk about the busy week they had
Then let's take a walk beside the lake
See what kinda fun we can make

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me
In a perfect love

Oh, ain't it a perfect love
I know you love me just because

Yeah, this is a perfect love
We're doin' nothin' but what a perfect love does
We're not tryin' to make history
It's just you and me

I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

[Verse 1: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]
From this moment life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

[Chorus 1: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]
I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
Ohh

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us

I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give

1878,Lee Ann Womack,32,Buckaroo,1998,"

I ain't a-looking for a smart guy school guy
Some proud in-crowd decked-out necktie
I need a man who can tame a wild mustang
Knows the difference 'tween love and a lust thang
Somebody who looks a whole lot like you
Buckaroo

Ain't interested in a ""yes 'mam"" yes man
I'll pass on the politically correct man
I'm set on fencing in a desperado
Takes my breath away like Colorado
Who ain't afraid to walk a mile in my boots
Buckaroo

Heaven knows what I might do
If I had me a cowboy like you
Buckaroo

Don't have to wow me like a long beard Shakespeare
Just talk plain talk right here in my ear
If you aspire to sophistication
I'll tell you now you're in the wrong location
Get out of here before this country girl gets to you

But if you like sunset on the painted desert
The Lone Ranger and spaghetti westerns
I'll tell you right now I'm the one for you

1879,Garth Brooks,33,To Make You Feel My Love,1998,"

[Verse]
When the rain's blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Verse 3]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
It's no doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 4]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Interlude]

[Verse 5]
The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea
Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free
But you ain't seen nothin' like me yet

[Verse 6]
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my... love

1880,Martina McBride,34,Happy Girl,1998,"

[Verse 1]
I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone
And a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Crying all my tears
With the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

[Chorus]
Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

[Verse 2]
I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside
Feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile
And my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I'm a happy girl

1881,John Michael Montgomery,35,Love Working On You,1998,"

You woke up this morning
Changes were taking place
You looked in the mirror
A smile was all over your face

'Cause out of nowhere
Someone was there
Who dared to climb
Those walls you made
It's exciting, a little frightening
But girl don't you be afraid

That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through

Can't even remember
All the sorrow that you left behind
It's a brand new day
There's a bright new way
And your tears have turned into wine

You never forget
When your eyes met
Or just how clearly you could see
Where the turns are deep in your heart
That lead you to believe

That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through

All of the while you felt forsaken
And all of the while
Love's been waiting, waiting

Suddenly you see how it could be
If we all only felt this way
And for a while girl you can see this world
Looking through the eyes of fate

That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through

That's just the love working
Love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through

That's just the love working on you
That's just the love working
Working on pulling you through

1882,Bryan White,36,Bad Day To Let You Go,1998,"

I've got a hole in my shoe
And a bad case of the blues
On top of that it's rainin too
I picked a bad day to let you go
I've got nothin but time
Nothin but you here on my mind
I guess the stars got out of line
I picked a bad day to let you go

Chorus:
Why did I walk away
I must have been crazy
If I could relive that day
I'd make it right, baby
It was just a wrong frame of mind
Wrong place, wrong time
But I know, I picked a bad day to let you go

I'm starin holes through these walls
Waitin on lady luck to call
But I know you wouldn't after all
I just picked a bad day to let you go

Why did I walk away
I must have been crazy
I'm payin for it everyday
But you're gone baby
It was just the wrong frame of mind
Wrong place, wrong time
But I know, I picked a bad day to let you go

1883,Hal Ketchum,37,I Saw The Light,1998,"

It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
So we walked along
Though I knew there was something wrong
And the feeling hot me oh so strong about you
Then you gazed up at me and the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
'Til that little bell began to ring in my head
In my head
But I tried to run
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light in your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes
And I ran out before but I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes

1884,Patty Loveless,38,To Have You Back Again,1998,"

Love, love's a chameleon
Makes one-in-a-million
Feel like too much of the same
But leave, leave it behind you
And love will remind you
It was only you that changed

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

[Verse 2]
Time, time is a river
Flowing forever
Away from the sound of your heart
Only you can break this silence
Whisper forgiveness
Let me back into your arms

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

[Verse 3]
And I know I never loved you
Like you needed to be loved
But I know that I could learn to
If we both have faith enough

[Chorus]
Oh, I'd give all my dreams
Give up my home and everything
I've ever known to have you back again
To have you back again, to have you back again
I'd stand in the rain, no place to hide
Drown in my shame, swallow my pride
To have you back again, to have you back again

To have you, to have you, to have you back again

Cautions in the wind
The hardest part is through
You don't have to try so hard
To make me fall for you

I've surprised myself
With what I've gone and done
Just today I heard myself
Swear you were the one

Chorus
Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do

You've been doing fine
Please don't change a thing
It's too good to hide away
So I might as well come clean

I didn't shout it out
But everybody knew
Funny you're the only one who didn't have a clue

I gave you my heart
Can't you feel the power
You want to see the light
Baby the sun's been up for hours

Under the sun, under the moon
Under the sky midnight blue
Under the maple, under the roof
I got down on my knees and told the truth

I told Him I was tired of feeling lonely
And I could really use my one and only

Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day

Na na na na na na
I heard you praying for
Na na na na na na
I got more, so much more

Just down the street, just down the road
Walking along, how could you have known
It must have been strange that little burning in your soul
Sorry 'bout the lightnin' bolt
But I told him I was tired of being lonely
And I could really use my one and only

Oh, oh, I said a prayer for you baby
And somehow it got through
Oh, oh I said a prayer for you baby
Now look at you
Wasn't God feelin' good that day
I said a prayer for you ...

Get ready baby, we're goin' uptown
It's Friday night, we're gonna get down
I thought you might like this brand new baby-blue dress
I figured out about a quarter until ten
We'll be partied out and headin' in
You and me alone darlin', doin' what we do best

Big time, we're gonna have one
Big time, we're gonna grab some
Lovin', huggin', cuddlin' up in rendezvous
'Cause I'm in love with you, big time

[Verse 2]
A little music, a sip of champagne
By candlelight, just doin' our thing
Let the crowd wonder, what in the world happened to us
Well they can boogie-woogie all night long
Let 'em dance until the cows come home
For what we want, this old honky-tonk ain't enough

[Chorus]
Big time, we're gonna have one
Big time, we're gonna grab some
Lovin', huggin', cuddlin' up in rendezvous
'Cause I'm in love with you, big time

Would become so estranged""

She said ""Na na na na na na na, now baby dont try
To figure this out or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise no love can survive
And trust with hearts, just don't apply""
She said ""Cause baby things change""

Na na na na na na na, so baby I quit tryin
To figure things out about all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise we couldn't survive
Yeah, I may be slow, but I ain't blind

She said ""I still love you so""
I said ""I don't care to know""
She said ""You once cried my name""
I said ""Well baby things change
Let's don't go placin' no blame
Cause you know things can change""

1889,Suzy Bogguss,43,Somebody To Love,1998,"

You're mascara's runnin' and your hair is a mess
And what have you spilled on your party dress
Sittin' in the kitchen all broken-hearted
Lookin' for comfort in an ice-cream carton
But all you want, all you really want

Is somebody to love, you want somebody
Oh, you've got to be strong
It's not enough to want somebody
Just 'cause the night is long
You've got to be tough and hold out honey 'cause
What you really want is somebody to love

I've been to all of the places you go to
And I've danced the tango with Cassanova
The wine and the roses are so continental
But the champagne is flat and the tux is a rental
All you want, all you really want

Is somebody to love, you want somebody
Oh, you've got to be strong
It's not enough to want somebody
Just 'cause the night is long
You've got to be tough and hold out honey 'cause
What you really want is somebody to love

Yeah, you want somebody
To tear the night apart
Someone to love you back, now honey
That's a darn good start

You've got to be tough and hold out honey 'cause
What you really want is somebody to love
Somebody to love...

1890,Lari White,44,Stepping Stone,1998,"

Here I am at another dead end
Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I wanna be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade
Ain't nothing new to me No

This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone

Now looking back I realize
How hard it is to recognize
Opportunity in disguise
That's some Calamity
So I ain't gonna cuss my luck
Every time a door slams shut
I know a window's gonna open up
Just as long as I believe

This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone

Stepping Stone.. Ohhh
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)
It's just a stepping
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping, stepping stone

1891,Wynonna,45,Always Will,1998,"

If time is a train rollin' down the track
Every minute is a box car that don't come back
Take a look around you, it's all gonna change
Whatever you see ain't never gonna stay the same
Except for the rain and the wind in the trees
And the way I feel about you and me
And the way I feel when I'm with you
Is like the roll of the ocean
And the calm and quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and you know it always will
Out on the horizon the sun is goin' down
It ain't gone, it's just on its way around
Just like your love I see it every day
In the things you do and the things you say
You touch my hand and I feel the thrill
I always have and I always will
And the way I feel when I'm with you
Is like the roll of the ocean
And the calm and quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and you know it always will
And the way I feel when I'm with you
Is like the roll of the ocean
And the calm and quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and you know it always will
You know it always will, you know it always will

1892,Clay Walker,46,Ordinary People,1998,"

I was standing at the checkout , by a rack of magazines
Cover story told about another heartbroke beauty queen
How she was getting over just one more sad affair
And as I waited for my change you know it hit me then and there

That (cause) ordinary people have extordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Then I heard some famous people had an anniversary
Five long years together it was hollywood history
Now my grandma and grandpa never made an old printed page
But they took the love of 57 years right to the grave

That (cause) ordinary people have extordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Now we all like to watch by the time the movie ends
Who of us hasn't wished to be a little more like them
But I bet everytime two stars are breaking up
That they wish somehow someway to be a little more like us

That (cause) ordinary people have extordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Oh the greatest gift I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be

Another highway
One more town

Down every winding road
Lonely won't leave me alone

On the edge of the gravel where the black top ends
We?re about to travel to where we?ve never been
Don?t need no signs no map we?ll just follow the wind

Cut a path through the wheat fields no way we?ll get lost
Set stones in the river so we can get across
And that mountain up ahead we?ll climb
Take off running up hill, yes, we will

'Cause there ain?t no end to this road
No matter what direction we go
As long as we?re together it goes on forever
There ain?t no end to this road

Well, this love is a journey to who knows where
We?ll get a little closer with every mile that we share
Whatever our destination we?ll let our hearts take us there
Yes, we?ll, will now

'Cause there ain?t no end to this road
No matter what direction we go
As long as we?re together it goes on forever
There ain?t no end to this road

Well, this love is a journey to who knows where
We?ll get a little closer with every mile that we share
Whatever our destination we?ll let our hearts take us there
Yes, we?ll, will now

'Cause there ain?t no end to his road
No matter what direction we go
As long as we?re together it goes on forever
Any kind of weather, baby whatever ain?t no end to this road

Ain?t no end to this road

It goes on and on and on, yes

You said, what you had to say, would come as a surprise
You were right, honey, you were right
You told me, nothing I could do was gonna change your mind
I knew then, you'd be right again

But, when you said we were through, I knew that wasn't true

That's where you're wrong, that's where you're wrong
Deep down inside love lingers on, it won't let go, it's still too strong
That's where you're wrong

I tell myself, I have to learn to leave the past behind
Looking back, I'm sure of that
I say, I'd be much better off, without you on my mind
Girl, it's true but what can I do

When I think these thoughts will end, my heart says, think again

That's where you're wrong, that's where you're wrong
Deep down inside love lingers on, it won't let go, it's still too strong
That's where you're wrong

Deep down inside love lingers on, it won't let go, it's still too strong
Stop and consider my heart if you think you're gone
That's where you're wrong

That's where you're wrong

1896,Wade Hayes,50,When The Wrong One Loves You Right,1998,"

They all said she was wrong for me
Her tender words were not what they seemed
But Lord it's hard puttin' up a fight
When the wrong one loves you right

It's easy to fall and easy to crawl
When you taste a little and you want it all
You close your eyes and hold on tight
When the wrong one loves you right

But take it from a fool who lost his cool
That girl's tricks sent me back to school
It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
When the wrong one loves you right

Now boys I'm certain it just ain't worth it
All that cryin' and all that hurtin'
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When the wrong one loves you right

But take it from a fool who lost his cool
That girl's tricks sent me back to school
It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
When the one loves you right

It messes with your heart
It messes with your mind
When the wrong one loves you right

Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is going to find your sail
That's where your journey starts

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're going to keep on coming back for more
Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walking
When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore

Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me

Life may not always go your way
And every once in a while you might have a bad day
But I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
The sky turns dark and everything goes wrong
Run to me and I'll leave the light on
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong
Here beside me
Heart and soul baby -- you only
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely

It's still gonna snow and it's still gonna rain
The wind's gonna blow on a cold winter day
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
You're safe from the world wrapped in my arms
And I'll never let go
Baby, here's where it starts
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
Here's a shoulder you can cry on
And a love you can rely on
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong

Here beside me
Heart and soul baby -- you only
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
No, no, you won't ever be lonely

1899,Steve Wariner,3,Two Teardrops,1999,"

(bill anderson/steve wariner)
(track 2 - time 4: 29)

Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good lord giveth and the good lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'til they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Two teardrops floatin' down the river
Two teardrops floatin' down the river

1900,George Strait,4,Write This Down,1999,"

[Verse 1]
I never saw the end in sight; fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright, but I was running out of time
Because you had one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, here's some final words from me

[Chorus]
Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Take my words, read them every day, keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down

[Verse 2]
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words, long after we're gone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh I love you and I don't want you to go, baby write this down

1902,Collin Raye,6,Anyone Else,1999,"

Baby I bought wine and roses on my way home
Yeah I know we can't afford it but life doesn't last too long
This world has gone half-crazy
And knocked us both to our knees
I'm fumbling for the words to try to tell ya
I love you for hangin' onto me

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

Mayday baby, all the rivets popped loose, it's a total tailspin
Too much grindstone, too little time with you
Girl, you know it's wearing thin
Baby let's trade in these teardrops
For warm kisses on skin
You got a drawer full of IOU's
And it's high time you called those things in

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

You've passed up so many chances
To walk right out that door
Instead of dodging a champagne cork
And watchin' the wet clothes fall to the floor

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And you can hide behind a Cheshire cat grin but you know it's true
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

Anyone else
Girl, anyone but you

1903,Mark Wills,7,Wish You Were Here,1999,"

They kissed goodbye at the terminal gate
She said, ""You're gonna be late if you don't go""
He held her tight, said, ""I'll be alright
I'll call you tonight to let you know""
He bought a postcard, on the front it just said Heaven
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, ""Hello"", I miss you so, wish you were here

She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ma'am the plane went down
Our crews have searched the ground
No survivors found she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail
That just said Heaven with a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loves her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, ""Hello"" I miss you so, wish you were here

The weather's nice, in paradise
It's summertime all year and all the folks we know
They say, ""Hello"" I miss you so, wish you were here
Wish you were here

At the local diner just outside of town
He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup
Another day, another dollar short of catching up

[Pre-Chorus]
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings

[Chorus]
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They may not have much, but he gets what they need
With the hands of a working man

[Verse 2]
Down at the factory, standing in line
He waits to punch the time clock
A million worries on his mind
Oh, Jimmy's needing braces
And Betty's needing time
And the problems that he's facing
They're all building up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings

[Chorus]
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They don't have much, but he gets what they need

Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings

You think I'm always making
Something out of nothing
You're saying everything's okay
You've always got an answer
Before I ask the question
Whatever you say
Now we can change the subject
Pretend I never brought it up
Same old story anyway
Later we can work it out
Right now you're talked out
Yeah, whatever you say

[Chorus]
Oh I know you can hear me
But I'm not sure you're listening
I hear what you're saying
But still there's something missing
Whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say

[Verse 2]
You say yes you need me
And no you wouldn't leave me
And this should be enough to make me stay
And even though I want to
I don't hear I love you
In whatever you say

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say[3x]

Big orange ball, sinking in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels

Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

[Chorus]
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

[Verse 2]
Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels

[Chorus]
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun

Hey, I want to know how forever feels
Girl, I want to know how forever feels

Here I am alone again tonight
In this old empty house
Its hard to learn what you don't think you need
That you can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've been gone

[Chorus]
Gone crazy
Going out of my mind
I've asked myself the reasons
Atleast a thousand times
Going up and down this hall way
Trying to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left
I've been gone

[Verse 2]
Never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
Things you said i never understood
Now crystal clear
Never spent this much time alone
But ever since you left
I've been gone

You could've heard a pin drop
When they walked trough the door
I had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor
Someone whispered ""Where's her halo?""
Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smiling
Holding on to the one who took my place

[Chorus]
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

I wonder if he told her she's the best he's ever known
The way he told me ev'ry night when we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm going through

[Chorus][x2]
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine

Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
This must be love

I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

Now it's all making sense
Forever's in the present tense
I know it all begins
With you
And so this story goes
I am yours to have and hold
And I can't wait to grow old
With you
Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
I'm crazy in love

I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
This could be love

I would go anywhere
Oh...I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

1910,Montgomery Gentry,14,Hillbilly Shoes,1999,"

I was there when the men came, and told us all the news
Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Till they walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes

You want to judge me by the whiskey on my breath
You think you know me but you ain't seen nothing yet
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes

You work all day in the muck and the mire
Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire
Ain't too much these boots can't do
Might even kick a little sense into you

Well I'm going up cripple creek going in a run
Going up cripple creek to have a little fun
Law man said they found some tracks
People saw them leavin but they never come back

Oh, you don't know me, you don't know, you don't know you don't know
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes

1911,Lee Ann Womack,15,I'll Think Of A Reason Later,1999,"

I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over
Had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Looking in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seeing her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

(Spoken)
Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick

There's a stranger in my mirror, who don't know how to behave. He keeps grinnin
Bout you and whistilin tunes, while he ought to be watchin, we move alike and

And he's always doin little things I never thought I'd do, like lookin at
Diamond rings, drwin hearts and writin I love you's. Thought it was just a case
Of mild affection, until I cought a glimpse of my reflection. I looked up into
My own eyes. And saw someone startin back I didn't recognize
There's a stranger in my mirror, who don't know how to behave. He keeps grinnin
Bout you and whistilin tunes, while he ought to be watchin, we move alike and
We loo the same but I swear we've got totally different brains and the love
We're in with you, just makes it clear, he used to be my win, now there's a
Stranger in my mirror. Lord I'm in love with you and there's a stranger in my
Mirror

1913,Reba,17,One Honest Heart,1999,"

[Verse 1]
Times are tough on an honest heart
People don't follow through with what they start
Lying eyes looking at me up and down
Making talk that's only cheap
Making promises they never keep
But I keep looking for what I still haven't found

[Chorus]
One honest heart
That I can believe in
Two loving arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard
Finding one honest heart

[Verse 2]
Now I've been close a time or two
I thought I saw my dreams coming true
But I was just living in a fairy tale
I won't play the fool again
I won't play a game that I can't win
But I still have faith and I keep telling myself, there's

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't think I'm asking too much
Just once in my life I want to be touched by

1914,Sammy Kershaw & Lorrie Morgan,18,Maybe Not Tonight,1999,"

You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words, ""I love you""
You just sit behind your paper
The silence cuts me like a razor
I'm gonna leave you
Maybe someday soon
When I can give up this fight
But maybe not tonight
We don't talk much anymore
Not the same way we used to
Whenever I reach out to hold you
You turn away, what am I supposed to do?
I'm gonna say goodbye
When the moment's right
Like an eagle I will fly
But maybe not tonight
Can you just hold me
In your arms so deep?
Wanna feel you breathin' on my skin
We fell out of love
We can fall back in
You never look at me that way
So many times I've longed to say
You used to brush the hair back from my face
Oh God, how I miss those days
You used to make me feel like someone
Tell me where did we go wrong
You were my best friend, my one and only love
You're still the only one
Just as I'm leaving you
You walk in the room
I see the flicker in your eyes
We say maybe not tonight
Can you just hold me
In your arms so deep
Wanna feel you breathin' on my skin
We fell out of love
(How did we fall out of love)
Maybe we can fall back in
You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words, ""I love you""
I love you

1915,John Michael Montgomery,19,Hello L.O.V.E.,1999,"

Tore out her page from my little black book
Took out her picture, gave it one last look
Hung a big sign out on the door
Saying ""Love don't live around here no more""

Packed up what was left of my pride
Topped up the tank for the long hard ride
Seventeen miles out of Loneliville
Yonder came my darlin' in a ""Coupe de Ville""

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O-V-E

Well I spun around then I hit the gas
Hot on the tail of that Cadillac
Said a little prayer, held my breath
Sure enough the green light turned to red

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O-V-E

She looked at me - I looked at her
A few days later in a little brown church
Made a sweet deal with the justice of the peace
Forty-five dollars for a license and a ring
(Forty-five dollars for a license and a ring)

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O
Hello L-O
Hello L-O-V-E

Been one tough week, dead on my feet
But, I've made plans for tonight
When I'm feeling blue, know just what to do
And how to make it right
Seems like I've needed this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember

Dim the lights, lock the door, spread your pictures
On the floor, throw the dust off of our past let it
All come floodin' back, cause' it ain't easy being
Strong and when I can't forget your gone I just
Surrender, and have myself a night to remember

Sad ain't my style but once in a while
I just have to give in
'Cause a woman like you, is so hard to lose
You just don't want it to end
I know this can't go on forever
So tonight I'll have a night to remember

Dim the lights, lock the door, spread your pictures
On the floor, throw the dust off of our past let it
All come floodin' back, cause' it ain't easy being
Strong and when I can't forget your gone I just
Surrender, and have myself a night to remember

Oh it ain't easy being strong and when I can't
Forget your gone I'll just surrender and have
Myself a night to remember

She's Perfect for a cotton dress
Pretty when her hair's a mess
A little wine and she gets a little loud
Once or twice she's bleached my jeans
She's been known to burn the beans
But in my heart there's never been a doubt

Chorus:
She's right as rain on a thristy cornfield
Right on the money about the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down

A little push and a hand to help
A quiet comfort on the troubled night
Right beside me yeah she's always right

Well she's the first to speak her mind
Never been the quittin' kind
She likes choclate
About as much as she likes me
She likes talkin' on the phone
Calls the mall her second home
I love that girl yeah she's just right for me

She's right as rain on a thristy cornfield
Right on the money about the way that I feel
A cool breath of fresh air
When life tries to burn me down

A little push and a hand to help
A quiet comfort on the troubled night
Right beside me yeah she's always right

This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark

You touch every place in my heart

I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?

It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

I'm gonna tell you something you don't wanna hear
You never listen when I talk
Maybe you'll listen when I walk
So I made my mind up and made a sandwich
And I didn't shed a tear
I gave you one last minute of my time
In this mess I left behind
When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

[Chorus 1]
My little good-byes
Empty hangers by the closet door
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
My little good-byes
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone
I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel
Little good-byes, little good-byes

I'm sure, you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two
You'll tape a Hallmark to my door
They always said it better than you
And if you're wondering
When you're gonna hear from me
Well, take a real good look around boy
And it won't hard to see
When you come home tonight and turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

My little good-byes
Took your favorite Dodger's hat
Left the litter, but I took the cat
My little good-byes
Loaded up the TV in the back of my car
Have fun watching the VCR
Little good-byes, oh baby, little good-byes

So, cry to your mama
And your sympathetic friends and tell'em
And tell them how the story ends

My little good-byes
Took the hourglass, left the sand
Now you got time on your hands
My little good-byes
Took the statue from Japan
Funny little Buddha man

My little good-byes
Change my voice on the machine
Or there'll be little good-byes with every ring
My little good-byes
Left the pictures and took the frame
I've got the umbrella, here comes the rain

You call and wake me up, the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry, déjà vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry

If only promises could just erase the past
I could open up my heart enough to take you back
But we've been down that road time and time again
I've learned the hard way how the story always ends

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out

There were hard times

I know we survived
Just because you stayed by my side

Whenever the road is too long
Whenever the wind is too strong
Wherever this journey may lead to

I will be there for you
I will be there for you
Through sorrow

On the darkest night
When there's heartache
Deep down inside
Just like a prayer
You will be there
And I promise you all my life

Whenever the wind is too strong
Wherever this journey may lead to

I will be there for you
I will be there for you
Through sorrow

Whenever the road is too long

I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realized that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did I think it was with you

[Verse 2]
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy now to think
That it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine

[Verse 3]
Standing there I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must've been at least three years ago

[Verse 4]
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine

[Verse 5]
Somewhere in my closet
There's a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf
It's full of faded memories
And it's been there ever since the night you left

[Verse 6]
Oh, just forgotten photographs
To remind me of the past
Oh, but I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Yeah, who needs pictures with a memory like mine

Stands in the feild with his ball and bat
Says, I am the greatest player of them all
Put his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up the ball

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says, I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

He makes no excuses
He shows no fear
He just closes his eyes
And listens to the cheers

[Verse 3]
Little boy, he adjusts his hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says, I am the greatest, the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

And the ball goes up when the moons so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the worlds so still as still can be
And the baseball falls and thats strike three

Now it's suppertime and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball
Says, I am the greatest that is a fact
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that!

Says, I am the greatest
That is understood
But even I didn't know
I could pitch that good....

This thing (this thing), called love (called love)

It shakes all over like a jellyfish

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike

This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready

As we passed in the hall
She said we need to talk
I can't go on like this another day
I froze in my tracks
And a chill ran up my back
'Cause I knew what she was gonna say

She said there's someone else
And I've kept it to myself
But I can't keep these feelings locked inside
I need to tell you this
It's one of your old friends
One you haven't talked to in a while

She said I'm leaving
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
'Cause she said you're not even close

It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me

I just stood there at a loss for words
Tryin' to catch my breath
'Cause I knew that it was over when

She said I'm leaving
And there's nothing you can do
I said I had a feeling that you found somebody new
And I'll bet I can guess his name
But it's so hard to believe
Oh she said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me

She said you're not even close
It's someone you don't know
I'm leaving you for me

"
1931,Kenny Chesney,35,You Had Me From Hello,1999,"

[Verse 1]
One word, that's all you said
Something in your voice called me, turned my head
Your smile, just captured me
You were in my future as far as I could see
And I don’t know how it happens, but it happens still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will

[Chorus]
Well you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

[Verse 2]
Inside I built a wall
So high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall
One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time I'd let someone in

[Chorus]
But you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won’t let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

[Outro]
That’s all you said
Something in your voice calls me, turns my head
You had me from hello
You had me from hello
Girl, I've loved you from hello

"
1932,BlackHawk,36,Your Own Little Corner Of My Heart,1999,"

After all this time I guess I finally made it through
All the darkness to the point of being over you
Now and then my mind runs into your old memory
But it ain't quite as big a deal as it used to be

Now I know even though you're not here
You will never be too far away
Anywhere, you'll be there
Like a whisper inside me each and every day
If I win, if I lose
You will always play a small part
Like a flame, you'll remain
In your own little corner of my heart

I thought every kiss you gave me time would just erase
I waited for the day they'd disappear without a trace
Finally I realized that even though you're gone
There'll always be an ember of you
Burning on and on

Chorus

"
1933,Mark Chesnutt,37,This Heartache Never Sleeps,1999,"

I worked myself to the bone
Tired as a man can get
It's the only way that I know
Might help me to forget
I lay me down
And I pray my soul to keep

Now, it's two a.m. and I should be
Sleeping like a log
But I can't blame the poundin' rain
Or the neighbor's barkin' dog
It's what you do to me
This heartache never sleeps

Yeah, twenty four hours of every day
I can feel it down in my chest
From the moment you walked away
Well, I ain't got no rest
It won't let me be
This heartache never sleeps

Well, like a ghost that haunts me
Down at the end of my bed
Your memory, it taunts me
And it won't stay out of my head
Till you come back
It ain't never gonna leave

So I might as well get out of this bed
And put the coffee on
Girl you know I'm not alone
At the breakin' of the dawn
'Cause just like me
This heartache never sleeps

Yeah, twenty four hours of every day
I can feel it down in my chest
From the moment you walked away
Well, I ain't got no rest
It won't let me be
This heartache never sleeps

It won't let me be
This heartache never sleeps

Won't let me be

Won't let me be
This heartache never sleeps...

1934,Deana Carter,38,Angels Working Overtime,1999,"

She was born at the rest stop on the Kansas state line
In the back of a Dodge in the summer time
Her momma named her Indiana like thier license plate
And with the hum of the tires on the interstate
She was cryin'
They left her at a Denny's up in Colorado
In a blanket with her name written on a note
That said, ""Forgive us Lord for not takin' her
But this child has a better chance of makin' it
In someone else's arms""
And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime
She was raised in a place called Cheyenne Wells
But she never fit in and everyone could tell
That she didn't belong in some prairie town
And when she turned eighteen she bought a ticket out
On a Greyhound
They stopped a few minutes out of Santa Fe
She got out for a smoke and they drove away
She hitched a ride with a boy right out of school
He said ""I'm headed out west""
And she said ""Me too""
If that's all right
And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime
It took a couple hundred miles 'till they fell in love
And if it ever was the only thing good enough
And in a moment of passion in a motel room
They held on tight and their aim was true
Now they're countin' down the days
And dreamin' all night in an apartment in L.A
And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime
And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime
She was born at a rest stop on the Kansas state line
Angels workin' overtime
She was cryin
She was cryin
She was cryin

1935,Faith Hill,39,The Secret Of Life,1999,"

[Verse 1]
Couple of guys, sitting around drinking
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of 'em says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""
He says, ""This is your life, and welcome to it
It's just working and drinking and dreams
Ad on TV says 'Just Do It'
Hell if I know what that means""

[Chorus]
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is a beautiful woman
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall

[Verse 2]
""You and me, we're just a couple of zeros
Just a couple of down-and-outs
But movie stars and football heroes
What have they got to be unhappy about?""
So they turn to the bartender, ""Sam, what do you think?
What's the key that unlocks that door?""
Sam don't say nothing, just wipes off the bar
And he pours them a couple more

[Chorus]
'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie

[Verse 3]
Sam looks up from his Sunday paper
Says, ""Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back""
Hey
The secret of life is getting up early
The secret of life is staying up late
The secret of life is try not to hurry
But don't wait
Don't wait

[Chorus]
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is to find the right woman
The secret of life is nothing at all
Oh, it's nothing at all
The secret of life

[Outro]
Couple of guys, sitting around drinking
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of them says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""
""That won't get you too far""

1936,Brooks & Dunn,40,I Can't Get Over You,1999,"

[Verse 1]
I forget where I'm going in my own house
I got myself in this, I'll get myself out
I talk out loud, at the top of my voice I sing
Whoa keep the faith, see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus]
I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just can't leave you alone
My mind won't believe you're gone
I can't get over you

[Verse 2]
I got a front row seat here to a fool's masquerade
And that fool in the mirror keeps saying I'm doing OK
I stare at that door that you walked out
It hits me hard and leaves no doubt

[Chorus][x2]

"
1937,Trisha Yearwood,41,I'll Still Love You More,1999,"

Ask me how much you mean to me
And I wouldn't even know where to start
Ask if this love runs deep in me
And you won't find a deeper love in any heart

You could say you couldn't live one day without me
You could say all of your thoughts are about me
You could think no other love could be as strong
But you'd be wrong
You'd be wrong

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

Ask me just what I'd do for you
And I'll tell you I would do anything
Ask if this heart beats true for you
And I'll show you a truer heart could never be

You could say there's not a star that you won't bring me
You could say there'll be no day that you won't need me
You could think no other love could last as long
But you'd be wrong
You'd be wrong

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more

And for every kiss
I'll kiss you back a hundred times
And for everything you do
I'll just do more
And for all the love you give
I'll give you so much back you'll see
Got so much love for you inside

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
No matter how much you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more...yeah

1938,Sara Evans,42,Fool  I'm A Woman,1999,"

[Verse 1:]
Use to think that I would be so sad
If you ever walked away
Use to think I needed you so bad
Did I say that I'd never leave you behind?
Well, just keep treating me unkind

[Chorus:]
'cause fool I'm a woman and I'm bound to change my mind

[Verse 2:]
With a woman it's imperative you show her that you love her
If you don't it's her prerogative to change like the weather
I'm seeing the signs
You know I use to think love was blind
Well, fool I'm a woman and I'm bound to change my mind
You use to tell me so many nights
You don't deserve me
Well, maybe you were right
Yesterday you offered me the world
Did you think I'd take it?
Now you treat me like some silly girl
Yeah, and that's where I'm drawing the line
You know I use to think you were so fine

[Chorus:]
Well, fool I'm a woman and bound to change my
Well, fool I'm a woman and I'm about to change my
Well, fool I'm a woman and I just changed my mind
And I'm about to change my mind

1939,Patty Loveless,43,Can't Get Enough,1999,"

Wake up in the morning, start the coffee boiling
I can't get enough
Throw the curtains open, let the sun shine in
I can't get enough
Well, I work real hard for every penny I make
Just trying to get the job done
At the end of the day I'm overworked and underpaid
I can't get enough

When the week is done I like to have some fun
I can't get enough
You can find me hanging out where the music's turned loud
I can't get enough
Yeah I'm lookin' for a guy who can light up my night
It don't even have to be love
A little huggin' and kissin'
I'm a girl on a mission
Can't get enough

We only get one time around
You better get it while you can
If you let this old world go and get you down
Life will slip right through your hands

So bring on the laughter and bring on the tears
I can't get enough
It's a race against time, just want to live 'til I die
I can't get enough
Yeah I'm going to take my turn
Gonna love, gonna learn until my numbers up
But for now I gotta run, the parties just begun
I can't get enough

We only get one time around
You better get it while you can
If you let this old world go and get you down
Life will slip right through your hands
Life will slip right through your hands
Oh I can't get enough
No no I can't get enough
Oh I can't... get enough

1940,Diamond Rio,44,I Know How The River Feels,1999,"

[Verse 1]
They say for everyone, there's that certain one
Out there... somewhere
I'd been lookin' hard, searchin' every heart
Getting... nowhere
Didn't know I was makin' my way to you

[Chorus]
Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holdin' fast, home at last
Knowin' the journey's through
Lyin' here with you
I know how the river feels

[Verse 2]
Miles of loneliness, now make perfect sense
Here be... side you
Tears like water fall, it was worth it all
Just to find you
And yours are the last arms I'll run to

[Chorus]
Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holdin' fast, home at last
Knowin' the journey's through
Lyin' here with you
I know how the river feels

[Outro]
Holdin' fast, home at last
Knowin' the journey's through
Lyin' here with you
I know how the river feels
Oh, I know how the river feels

1941,Brooks & Dunn,45,South Of Santa Fe,1999,"

[Verse 1]
Where the rain don't fall and the grass don't grow
The older part of New Mexico
I drifted into town one day
And stumbled in on a lost cafe
Shades were pulled and the door was locked
Something made me knock
Time stood still when she opened the door
I didn't know where I was anymore
And we were lost in each other's eyes
Where loneliness meets paradise
Something in my heart broke free
Blowing wind as the tumbleweed

[Chorus]
Somewhere north of heaven
Where eagles fear to fly
Where the sun burns hot as the devil's gate
The desert meets the sky
Tattooed on my memory is the image of an angels face
North of heaven, south of Santa Fe

[Verse 2]
Bad news tends to travel fast
I was running from my past
I left her when their morning broke
Truth is I never let her go
I'm still running free
But in my heart I'll always be

[Chorus]

"
1942,Mary Chapin Carpenter,46,Almost Home,1999,"

[Verse 1]
I saw my life this morning
Lying at the bottom of a drawer
All this stuff I'm saving
God knows what this junk is for
And whatever I believed in
This is all I have to show
What the hell were all reasons
For holding on for such dear life
Here's where I let go

[Chorus]
I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home

[Verse 2]
I saw you this morning
You were staring back at me
From an ancient photograph
Stuck between some letters and some keys
I was lost just for a moment
In the ache of old goodbyes
Sometimes all that we can know is
There's no such thing as no regrets
But baby it's all right

[Chorus]
I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home

But there's no such thing as no regrets
And baby it's alright
I'm not running
I'm not hiding
I'm not reaching
I'm just resting in the arms of the great wide open
Gonna pull my soul in
And I'm almost home

You can't buy it at the store, try it on for size
Then bring it back if it don't feel right
No love, love ain't like that
You can't trade it in like an automobile
That's got too many miles an' rust on it's wheels
No love, love ain't like that

[Chorus]
Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time

[Verse 2]
It don't fall from the sky like a tiny drop of rain
That hits you right between the eyes one day
No love, love ain't like that
You can't put your money down an' just roll the dice
Think you're gonna win it all some night
No love, love ain't like that

Love, yeah
Love ain't that easy to define
You can't build it by design
It takes its own sweet time

You can't buy it at the store, try it on for size
Bring it back if it don't feel right

1944,Doug Stone,48,Make Up In Love,1999,"

Bobby was a beautiful girl
From a small town in a great big world
Her daddy owned the corner store
Off of 7th Ave

Danny-Jo just turned 19
Cigarettes rolled under his sleeve
His leather jacket and his faded jeans
And a bad attitude

But it's hard to be tough
When you're falling in love

(chorus)
And he said:
I know I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one your only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that I don't have that much
But for whatever I don't have
I'll make up in love

Her daddy was a simple man
He raised Bobby with a real stern hand
Said he never would understand
Just what she saw in him

After workin' at the store all day
Bringin' in an honest day's pay
Man you shoulda seen his face
When Danny-Jo walked in

Sayin' please understand
With a ring in his hand

(chorus)
And he said:
I know I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one her only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that I don't have that much
But for whatever I don't have
I'll make up in love

(Bridge)
Now he lookes back and smiles
At how they walked down the isle
20 years have gone by
He remembers it still
How she bid his will
With a look in her eyes
Now he knows she was right

(chorus)
When she said:
Daddy, I'm down on my knees
But I wanna be the one his only one
I'm beggin' you please
And I know that he don't have that much
But for whatever we don't have
We'll make up in love

And for whatever they don't have
They make up in love

1945,Billy Ray Cyrus,49,Give My Heart To You,1999,"

[Verse 1]
I gave two teeth in a teenage brawl
For a girl whose name I can't recall
Then we broke up
I gave a knee to the football team
Chasing that high school state champ dream
We almost won
I gave junior college almost a year
Then I gave a Greyhound twenty bucks and that's how I got here

[Chorus]
I give all my money for a slice of daily bread
I give forty honest hours to a boss I never met
And I gave my soul to Jesus at the age of twenty-two
So there ain't much left to offer but I give my heart to you

[Verse 2]
I gave a beard and a head of hair
To a boot camp corporal with a barber's chair
At Camp Le Jeune
I gave Uncle Sam what he bargained for
Twenty-four months not a minute more
I just didn't fit in
Then I gave a high school friend of mine a call
And we gave a body shop a try till we gave up last fall

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I gave my soul to Jesus at the age of twenty-two
So there ain't much left to offer but I give my heart to you

1946,Ricochet,50,Seven Bridges Road,1999,"

There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet in honey
Down the seven bridges road

You one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you, baby
When you're driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you (You laugh and breathe)
Love the way you love me (And smile when you touch me)

1948,Andy Griggs,2,She's More,2000,"

I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

"
1949,Clay Walker,3,The Chain Of Love,2000,"

He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis""
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
""Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe.""

1950,Chad Brock,4,Yes!,2000,"

She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

She said yes

1951,Kenny Rogers With Alison Krauss & Billy Dean,5,Buy Me A Rose,2000,"

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

[Chorus]

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life

1952,George Strait,6,The Best Day,2000,"

We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

"
1953,Collin Raye,7,Couldn't Last A Moment,2000,"

I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
That's the bottom line
I wasted so much precious time, baby
I see with your friend
Wearing a smile again

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

Oh girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment(moment)
Without you
Ohhhh

"
1954,Toby Keith,8,How Do You Like Me Now?!,2000,"

[Verse 1]
I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote ""Call for a good time""
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

[Verse 2]
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing
Its me baby, with your wakeup call!

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

[Outro]
Tell me baby
I will preach on

"
1955,Kenny Chesney,9,What I Need To Do,2000,"

[Verse 1]
I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on

[Bridge]
Knowing what I need to do
Girl, I'm coming home to you

[Outro]
Knowing what I need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
Knowing what I need to do

"
1956,Clay Davidson,10,Unconditional,2000,"

Daddy waited up
In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone

Pre chorus:
And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok

Chorus:
But u can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let u go
Son my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away

Pre Chorus:
And before u slammed that door
U said i hate u
But tonightif u could only hear me say

Chorus:
U can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let u go
Girl always know
My love is unconditional

Tag:

U could turn away forget me
Curse my name
But you can't even let me go
Girl but you need to know
My love, is unconditional

1957,Clint Black With Steve Wariner,11,Been There,2000,"

Clint Black & Steve Wariner

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
And wonder where you were
You need the one and only that can hold you tight
And you reach for her, but she's not with you
You just wish this trip would end
You know I've been there, I don't wanna go back again

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
And wonder who you are
You suddenly discover there's a price you pay
For gettin' this far, and it's the part of you
You really don't have to spend
You know I've been there, and I don't wanna go back again

There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no

Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream
That didn't come true
You think you're gotta give up on makin' that scene
And seeing it through, you feel like breaking
When you really just need to bend
You know I've been there, and I'll never go back again

There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no

"
1958,Phil Vassar,12,Carlene,2000,"

I was lousy at math, failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarter back in the back of classes
She was the whiz kid in horned rim glasses

It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, ""I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever.""
It took a second to put it all together and I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

She said hop in let's go for a spin
Tell me whatcha been doing boy and where you been
I said I write songs, you probably didn't know, but I
Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, ""What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money.""
Imagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said you've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without hesitation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

I said I hope to see you again someday
She said another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my Momma's at eight!

And I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean

1959,Lee Ann Womack With Sons Of The Desert,13,I Hope You Dance,2000,
1960,Trace Adkins,14,More,2000,"

[Verse 1]
If anybody had told me, that anybody'd have a hold on me
I'd say they were out of their mind
But speakin' of crazy, I'm findin' lately
All I want, all I need, all the time is

[Chorus]
More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more

[Verse 2]
I can't explain it, I'm more than infatuated
You got me good, I got it bad
There's no doubt about it, I can't live without it
What you got I just got to have, so give me

[Chorus]
More of your sweet love, too much just ain't enough
I never needed a fix like this before
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more

[Chorus]
Too strong to resist, I don't know when to quit
Like a kid in a candy store, you keep me comin' back for more

[Outro]
You keep me comin' back for more
You keep me comin' back for more, more, and more , and more
Comin' back for more, more
Keep me comin', give me some more
I'm comin' back for more

1961,Tim McGraw,15,Some Things Never Change,2000,"

[Verse 1]
After all this time I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change

[Verse 2]
When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change

[Outro]
I still love you

"
1962,Reba McEntire,16,I'll Be,2000,"

[Verse 1]
When darkness falls upon your heart and soul
I'll be the light that shines for you
When you forget how beautiful you are
I'll be there to remind you
When you can't find your way
I'll find my way to you
When troubles come around
I will come to you

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

[Verse 2]
And when you're there with no one there to hold
I'll be the arms that reach for you
And when you feel your faith is running low
I'll be there to believe in you
When all you find are lies
I'll be the truth you need
When you need someone to run to
You can run to me

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

[Bridge]
I'll be the sun
When your heart's filled with rain
I'll be the one
To chase the rain away

[Chorus]
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

1963,Yankee Grey,17,Another Nine Minutes,2000,"

6:30 in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
(Another nine minutes) Let the world stop
(Another nine minutes) Don't worry about the clock
(Another nine minutes) Ooooh, yeah
(Another nine minutes) Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late

(Another nine minutes) (repeat to fadeout)

[Intro]
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doin' the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone

[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)

[Verse 2]
I made a bad miscalculation
Bettin' you would never leave
'Cause if you're gettin' on with your new life
Then where does that leave me?

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right

Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

Hoping that I didn't wait too long (I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart, I know that you love me as much as I love you
(You know I love you, girl)
And that you must be lyin' somewhere, looking up to heaven too

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong

1965,Brad Paisley,19,Me Neither,2000,"

[Verse 1 - Brad Paisley]
Darling I've been standing here just watching you all night
And I think I've even caught you watching me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb, but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight

[Verse 2 - Brad Paisley]
Me neither
I'm glad that we agree
Believe me
That's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat
Me neither

[Verse 3 - Brad Paisley]
It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking, that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
And darling tell me, would you like to dance

[Verse 4 - Brad Paisley]
Me neither
I was just being polite
Thank goodness
My feet are much too tired
I'm sure you're tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinking there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm running outta lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song
Me neither

"
1966,Martina McBride,20,Love's The Only House,2000,"

[Verse 1]
I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

[Chorus]
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain

[Verse 2]
He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

[Verse 4]
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playing out of tune
City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey
Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that

[Chorus][x2]

1967,Eric Heatherly,21,Flowers On The Wall,2000,"

I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
But all that thought you've given me is, conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryinbout me, I'm havin'lots of fun

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

1968,Lonestar,22,What About Now,2000,"

[Verse 1]
The sign in the window said for sale or trade
On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made
Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

[Verse 2]
And that road rolls out like a welcome mat
I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
We always said someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

[Chorus]
What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

[Verse 3]
We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line

[Chorus]
What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

[Bridge]
We could hang around this town forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance

[Chorus]
What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

Yeah, oh
What about now?

1969,Dixie Chicks,23,Cowboy Take Me Away,2000,"

[Verse 1]
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

[Verse 2]
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

[Verse 3]
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds good to me

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you

The first time I looked in your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face I felt
Like I've never felt with anyone else

[Verse 2]
I wanna give back what you've giving to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man

[Chorus]
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything

[Verse 3]
When you wake up, I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out for me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
And I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost

[Chorus]
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything

[Verse 4]
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything

And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh
You're my best friend

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend (my best friend)
You're my best friend (my best friend)

1973,Brooks & Dunn,27,You'll Always Be Loved By Me,2000,"

[Verse 1]
I know forever is a long long time
For a girl to put her heart on the line
Trust is a tight rope we all have to walk
Baby don't be afraid I won't let you fall
With a little faith mountains move
You and me we can't lose

[Chorus]
You can count on the sun to rise
And stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me

[Verse 2]
Love comes so many times goes
So much out there we'll never know
Call it fate call it destiny
But I think we were meant to be
This old world it spins so fast
So many times they just don't last

[Outro]
You'll always be loved by me

First I get cold and hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
It must be love

[Chorus]
It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love

[Verse 2]
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'til morning light
It must be loveSeeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love

It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love

It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove

1975,Joe Diffie,29,It's Always Somethin',2000,"

Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by
What else can I do, but wonder if it's you
Scanning the stations, every song they're playin'
Is like a soundtrack, to the love we had
I should be over you by now, but every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something

Lunch time, a new place
Waitress says her name
Why does it have to be, Emily
Corner store, stop in
Someone ask, ""How ya been?""
I say I wouldn't know
I really gotta go
Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how
Cause every time I turn around...

It's always somethin' every day remindin' me
Everywhere I go, there's a memory
Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard
There's no way to prepare my heart
What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do
If only I could just stop missin' you
I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing
But it's always something

I won't be ignored
I won't be bored
Hey!

I won't be your dirty secret
I won't be your cure-all pill
And I won't run to fetch the water
Just to tumble down the hill

I won't be your Friday paycheck
I won't be the prize you flaunt
And I won't be your Martha Stewart, baby
Or your all night restaurant

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heels
I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels

I won't be your obligation
I won't be your Barbie doll
I won't be the portrait of perfection
To adorn your wall

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

Bridge:
Hey - you know I will
All right

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be the last in line

But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
You know I will...but

Yeah, I will, I will, I wll be your everything
I will, I will be the whole shebang

1977,Ty Herndon,31,No Mercy,2000,"

[Verse 1]
Don't think ""I'm sorry"" what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door
A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby until I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
Hold me baby, you know I've been hurting
Love this love back to life cause it's worth it
Love me strong baby, show me no mercy tonight

[Verse 2]
Remember when we thought that being apart
Would be the best thing for both our hearts
It's a prison out there when you're living
Alone for sure
Now I know how much I really missed you
No more games, just want to be with you
Just give me all your love
Till you can't give anymore

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the silence of the early hours
I look at you and I feel the power
Don't need promises to make it right
Let's just follow what we're feeling inside

1978,Steve Wariner,32,Faith In You,2000,"

If you were the sun
And one day you lost all your light
And you disappeared
I'd stand in the dark all alone
And wait through the night
And I'd feel no fear
I might not know what to do
But you'd shine again like brand new
I've got that much faith in you

Chorus:
If ever the lights were to go out between us
If ever the raindrops should start to fall
Should the winds of distrust ever rock our foundation
I know we could weather it all
I might not know what to do
But I do know we'd make it through
I've got that much faith in you

And if you were the moon
And one night a big black cloud
Came and covered your face
I'd stand in the rain
Like a statue tall and proud
Till the clouds blew away
I might not know what to do
But you'd make the rain roll on through
I've got that much faith in you

Chorus:

[Verse 1]
The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July

[Chorus]
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

[Verse 2]
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

[Chorus]
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that
You would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July

I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
But all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want when it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth

[Chorus]
I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you

You're the hope that moves me
To courage again, oh yeah
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far

I need you like water, like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms

Almost made you love me
Almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby

Didn't I, didn't I

You almost had me thinkin'
You were turned around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe
You'd found it in me
But you can't get to heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

Gonna find me somebody
Not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt be there kind of girl
You came real close
But every time you built me up
You only let me down
And everybody knows
Almost doesn't count

I can't keep lovin' you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin'
If you're looking for more
Than all I could give you
Than what you came here for

Maybe you'll be sorry
Maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back, babe
From the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me
You're gonna stick around
But everybody knows (everybody knows!)
Almost doesn't count

So maybe I'll be here
Maybe I'll see ya' round
That's the way it goes
Almost doesn't count

1982,Darryl Worley,36,When You Need My Love,2000,"

Two in the mornin', telephone rings
Somehow I knew it who was
Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love

You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl, I know you've been fightin' with him
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart

He'll call tomorrow with the same old lines
And you'll forget about us
And I'll be lonely until the next time
When you need my love

Chorus:
Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart

Now someday, someone's gonna love me true
And baby when she does
Then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

Yeah then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

When you need my love

When you need my love
What are you gonna do
Ohhhhh

1983,Jo Dee Messina,37,That's The Way,2000,"

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take a drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find it's a winding road
I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Somethin' else knocks me down

[Chorus]
Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is

[Verse 2]
One fine day you wake up
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything
The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well, I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need

[Chorus]
Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is

[Bridge]
Yeah
They say your soul is growin' but
Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'

[Chorus]
And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
And that's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
Oh, and that's the way it is

[Outro]
Oh, that's the way it is (that's the way it is)
Yeah (that's the way it goes)
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
Oh, you gotta bend when the wind blows
Oh, that's the way it goes
That's the way it is
That's the way it goes
Oh, yeah
You gotta roll with the punches

1984,Garth Brooks,38,When You Come Back To Me Again,2000,"

[Verse 1]
There's a ship out, on the ocean
At the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about, lost and broken
Wandering aimlessly

And God somehow you know that ship, is me

[Verse 2]
'Cause there's a lighthouse, in a harbor
Shining faithfully
Pouring its light out, across the water
For this sinking soul to see

That someone out there still believes in me

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end

When you come back to me again

[Verse 3]
There's a moment, that we all come to
In our own time, and our own space
Where all that we've done, we can undo
If our heart's, in the right place

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end

And you come back to me again

[Bridge]
And again I see, my yesterday's in front of me
Unfolding like a mystery, you're changin' all that is and used to be

[Chorus]
On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end

When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again

Hello mom and dad, what's been goin' on
I know it's been awhile, since I've written home
I like my new job, sure I like this town
But I finally got me something to write home about

She's got long blonde hair, and deep blue eyes
She likes the music loud and walkin' in the moon light
She laughs sometimes, sometimes until she cries
Oh mom, I'm in love, and dad, I'm sure you'd be proud
'Cause I finally got me something to write home about

I got that raise in pay now ain't just getting by
Looks like I'm on my way I guess I must be livin' right

Sometimes it's hard to don't wanna look over your shoulder
'Cause you don't want to remember where you've been
There'll come a time you die
If you could only hold her
'Cause I know that's where I am

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of a heart

Sometimes you'll drown it out with all your rage and thunder
Sometimes you'll drown it out with all your tears
There'll come a time when you hear it and you'll wonder
""Where in the world have I been?""

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of a heart
No one can tell you how to get there
It's a road you take all by yourself
All by yourself
All by yourself

So listen with all your heart
Hold it inside forever
You may find all your dreams have already come true
Look inside and find the part that's leading you
'Cause that's the beat of

I could say it's all her fault
She never had any patience at all
I'm a complicated guy, and she didn't try to understand
I could claim I had nothing to do with the fact I'm lonesome and blue
But that wouldn't be true I'm a self made man

Ya I'm the one that fooled around
And let the one who loved me down
She had more of me then she could stand
Well I blamed everyone but me
And now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where i am
I'm a self made man

I could blame it on the way I was raised
Or I could say I was just to afraid
To lay my heart in somebody elses hands
I can alwats make one more excuse
But in the end whats the use I might as well face it
I'm a self made man

Ya I'm the one who fooled around
Let the one who loved me down
Cause she had more of me than she could stand
I blamed everyone but me
But now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where I am
I'm a self made man

Whoaaaa I blamed everyone but me
But now that it's to late I see
Nobody helped me get to where I am

A self made man

A self made man

Ahhh I can't blame nobody but me

No, I haven't seen the sky tonight
Too many clouds, there's no starlight
But I know it's true
There must be a blue moon

I got the message you left early today
No signs, no warnings to give you away
Not even goodbye
It was the only way

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight
No misconceptions, yes, I know it's right
'cause I've never been so blue in all my life

No, don't call a friend 'cause nobody should know
It's just between me, my heart and my soul
And the memories perfectly placed in my mind
The more I think it over, well, the more I know it's true
The reason you left me, why I'm feeling so blue…
There must be a blue moon

There's a blue moon out tonight
No, I don't see it but I feel its light
Come pouring through the clouds you left above my head
There's a blue moon out tonight

1991,Trisha Yearwood,45,Real Live Woman,2000,"

I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned
I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am

I ain't a movie star
May never see the view from where they are
And this old town may be as far as I'm goin'
And what he'll hold tonight in his hands
He swears there's so much better than
Anything that this old world can show him

I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman

I work 9-5 and I can't relate
To millionaires who somehow fate
Has smiled upon and fortune made their
Common lives a better place to be
And I no longer justify
Reasons for the way that I behave
I offer no apologies
For the things that I believe and say
And I like it that way

'Cause I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman

I need a car when I'm driving
A plane when I'm flying
A call takes a quarter and dime
I need a radio playing
When there's nothing worth saying
And help when I'm falling behind
Extra rest on occasion Holiday or vacation
But I need you all the time

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time

I need boots when I'm walking
Southern drawl when I'm talking
And run when I want to unwind
A little cash when I'm going
Some freedom for growing
Some preaching to keep me in line
They can build it or dream it
I could take it or leave it
But I need you all the time

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine

1993,The Kinleys,47,She Ain't The Girl For You,2000,"

Tears on the phone around midnight
You assume I'll be alone
She hurt you once, hurt you twice
You keep asking for my advice
How many times you have to hear the truth?

She ain't the girl for you
She makes you cry and still you stay
Why can't you just walk away
Everytime you hurt it hurts me too
She ain't the girl for you

You know I play the part of the friend
Who bandages your broken heart
And in return you turn to me
There's a limit to what I can be
What I am she can not do

She ain't the girl for you
She makes you cry and still you stay
Why can't you just walk away
Everytime you hurt it hurts me too
She ain't the girl for you

I'm the one who understands
It's me who holds your hand

She makes you cry and still you stay
Why can't you just walk away
Everytime you hurt it hurts me too
She ain't the girl for you

She ain't, she ain't, she ain't, she ain't the girl
(She ain't the girl, she ain't, she ain't the girl for you)
She ain't, she ain't, she ain't, she ain't the girl
(She ain't the girl, she ain't, she ain't the girl for you)
She ain't, she ain't, she ain't, she ain't the girl
(She ain't the girl, she ain't, she ain't the girl for you)
She ain't, she ain't, she ain't, she ain't the girl

I been losin' my mind one love at a time
Gettin' up just to be knocked down
But with all of that pain I come back again
And I always go one more round

Women, me and love
We just can't get it right
I might lose the battle
But I love the fight 

No love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

I got a big long list of all the times
I've missed when I zeroed in on love
And at times it seems like one heartache
Begins where the last one has just left off

And tonight it looks like another
One is aimed in my heart
And she's looking at me
And I'm feeling that feelin' start 

Oh, love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

And tonight it looks like another
One is aimed in my heart
And she's looking at me
And I'm feeling that feelin' start

Oh, love you ain't seen the last of me
I just keep comin' back to see if I can capture the dream
Yeah love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me

Yeah, love you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily, no you ain't seen the last of me...

1996,Sons Of The Desert,50,Change,2000,"

Billy's standing out by a west Texas highway
With his thumb in the morning air
He's spent 18 summers in the dust of Odessa
Never getting nowhere
But he's got him a misspelled cardboard of
Albuquerque
Standin' in the breakdown lane
He ain't lookin' for a ride so much as he's looking for a

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Change
Even for the worse, it would be better somehow
Sometimes you just cross that line
Where everything is more of the same
When it's do or die, step aside, turn the tide
Something's gotta change

Betty's walkin' out of a tattoo parlor
She's got curlers in her hair
She still can't believe she had a little red rose
Put right on her derriere
And she's still gotta pick up that red lace teddy
And a bottle of pink champagne
Well her husband doesn't know it
But tonight well
He's in for a

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Yeah a change
Even for the worse would be better somehow
Sometimes you just cross that line
Where everything is more of the same
When it's do or die, step aside, turn the tide
Somethin's gotta change

Now who of us hasn't been heading home on Friday
Sitting at some traffic light
Wondering what would happen if we just took a left
Instead of takin' that faithful ole right
It's the human condition, part of us wishes
That life wouldn't get so tame
And we all know better than to think that's ever gonna

Change, a little something different for cryin' out loud
Yeah a change
Even for the worse would be better somehow
Looking for a change
Change
Yeah a change
Looking for a change, yeah

1997,Brooks & Dunn,1,Ain't Nothing 'Bout You,2001,"

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

1998,Tim McGraw,2,Grown Men Don't Cry,2001,"

[Verse 1]
I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

[Chorus]
But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

[Verse 2]
Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

[Chorus]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 3]
I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

[Chorus x2]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 2]
To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something

Oh yeah

Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love

Was it the pull of the moon now baby
That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy
I think it's something more
I've never felt the Earth move honey
Until you school my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on

If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah

We're hanging right on the edge now baby
The wind is getting stronger
We're hanging on by a thread now honey
We can't hold on much longer
It's a long way down but it's too late

If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall

I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her

2003,Lonestar,7,I'm Already There,2001,"

[Verse 1]
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

[Chorus 1]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

[Verse 2]
She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

[Chorus 2]
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

[Bridge]
We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

[Chorus 3 + Outro]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already

2004,Mark McGuinn,8,Mrs. Steven Rudy,2001,"

I get up on Sunday, about eight-fifteen
Just to get the paper that I never read
'Cause I know she'll be there barely in her robe
Sittin' on her front porch paintin' on her toes
Her husband's always on the road

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Sometimes Mrs. Rudy calls cryin' late at night
'Cause her and Mr. Ugly have had another fight
We talk a while, and I hear her smile
When she says thank you, I tell her that she's welcome
Like any friend would do
I only wish she knew

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Imagination, infatuation
I'm what she deserves
I wonder if she thinks about me
The way I think about her

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Oh Mrs. Rudy
That wedding ring is as ugly to me
As your husband is to you

You don't know
You don't know what you do

Smiling just to see

Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Verse 2]
There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through

When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own

2008,Jessica Andrews,12,Who I Am,2001,"

If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
And when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine
Cause nothing changes who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I'm a saint
And I'm a sinner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young
But I am able

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

2009,Montgomery Gentry,13,She Couldn't Change Me,2001,"

Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be
Yeah, she changed her mind when she couldn't change me

2010,Brad Paisley,14,Two People Fell In Love,2001,"

[Verse 1]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[Chorus]
There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

[Verse 2]
Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[Chorus]

[Tag]
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon

2011,Diamond Rio,15,One More Day,2001,"

[Verse 1]
Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you

[Chorus]
One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

[Verse 2]
First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

[Chorus]
One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day
One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day, one more day

I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

[Bridge]
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

"
2013,Jo Dee Messina,17,Downtime,2001,"

[Verse 1]
I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose a part of me when my heart is on the mend
I'll be alright it's safe to say
'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase

[Chorus]
Well, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Well, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime

[Verse 2]
Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime

[Bridge]
Well, time is meant to play the part
In taking care of broken hearts

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little
Oh, I'm just going through a little
I'm just going through a little downtime

"
2014,Aaron Tippin,18,People Like Us,2001,"

There's a pool hall, jukebox and
Sawdust floors
Three plays for a quarter and they still
Want more
Yeah, there's a reason for fast cars
And that double yellow line
Hearbread songs and good cheap
Two dollar wine

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

I got a second-hand boat, the last owner's in jail
There's second-hand smoke everywhere I exhale
There's greasy little truck stops and all night dives
No tell motels and everybody knows why

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, longneck
Bottles, rusty old pick up trucks
Oh, at last call the lights go up
And it's all because of people like us

2015,Jamie O'Neal,19,When I Think About Angels,2001,"

[Verse 1:]
Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Verse 2:]
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Ohhh, ohh, ohhhh
When I think about you, baby
Yeah, yeah
I think about you

2016,LeAnn Rimes,20,But I Do Love You,2001,"

[Verse 1]
I don't like to be alone in the night
And I don't like to hear
I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you
But I do love you
I don't like to see the sky painted grey
And I don't like when nothing's going my way
And I don't like to be the one with the blues
But I do love you
But I do love you

[Chorus]
I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head
Upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do

[Verse 2]
And I don't like to turn the radio on
Just to find I missed my favorite song
And I don't like to be the last with the news
But I do love you
But I do love you

[Chorus]
I love everything about the way you're loving me
The way you lay your head
Upon my shoulder when you sleep
And I love to kiss you in the rain
I love everything you do, oh I do

And I don't like to be alone in the night
And I don't like to hear
I'm wrong when I'm right
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes
But I do love you

But I do love you
But I do love you
But I do love you

2017,Clay Davidson,21,Sometimes,2001,"

She got my full attention
With an out of nowhere question
I thought she knew the answer to
She felt the need to ask
Cause just last night she'd had
Some crazy dream about losing me
She said do I still turn you on and fill your every need
I need to hear you say you still love me

CHORUS:
And I don't mean sometimes
Not almost always
Not a little or most times
All night and all day
Tell me I'm in your heart and on
Your mind
Baby and I don't mean sometimes

I told her darlin' shake me
Next time that you're awakened
By the thought that I could go
And I'll take you in my arms
Oh with all my heart
I'll make it clear that I ain't going nowhere

Yes you're all I want and all I'll ever need
I'm still hopelessly in love as I can be

And I don't mean sometimes
Not almost always
Not a little or most times
All night and all day
Tell me I'm in your heart and on
Your mind
Baby and I don't mean sometimes

She got my full attention
With an out of nowhere question
I thought she knew the answer to

2018,Chris Cagle,22,Laredo,2001,"

[Verse 1]
You've always been a friend of mine
That's the way we'll be 'til the day I die
Yeah, it's good to know you're on my side
'Cause now you know she's leavin' me
And I need your help to make her see
So, turn on your charm and let it shine

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you've always been the one
Who could make her stay around
So when she gets to the city limits sign
Don't let me down

[Chorus]
Oh, Laredo, don't let her go
Just take her by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Whoa, Laredo, you're my only hope
So, get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo

[Verse 2]
Make her think about the moonlit walks
And the long, long talks by the water's edge
With her feet hangin' off the cane creek bridge
Bring to mind the first kiss we shared
At the old town square when she drives down there
'Cause that's the day she said she could never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep the nights by the candlelight
As an ace in the hole
'Cause those are nights of passion
That I know will bring her home

[Chorus]
Oh, Laredo, don't let her go
Just take her by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Whoa, Laredo, you're my only hope
So, get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo, yeah!

[Chorus]
Whoa, Laredo, don't let her go
Just take her by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Whoa, Laredo, you're my only hope
So, get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
Oh, but please don't let her go
Oh, Laredo

[Verse 1]
If I ever write
The story of my life
Don't be surprised
If you're where it begins
Girl, I'd have to dedicate
Every line on every page
To the memories we made
While you loved me

[Chorus]
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
While you loved me

[Verse 2]
I'd start with chapter one
Love innocent and young
As a morning sun, on a new day
Even though I know the end
Well, I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in
While you loved me

[Chorus]
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
While you loved me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me, yeah
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
I lived
I was born the day you kissed me (The day you kissed me, baby)
And I died inside the night you left me, yeah
But I lived
Oh, how I lived
I lived
While you loved me

2020,Keith Urban,24,Where The Blacktop Ends,2001,"

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Verse 1]
I'm looking' down the barrel of Friday night
Riding' on a river of freeway lights
Goodbye city I'm country bound
Till Monday rolls around

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Verse 2]
Working in the grind is an uphill road
Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

[Bridge]
Give me some fresh air give me that farm
Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise

[Chorus]
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends
Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends

2021,Faith Hill,25,If My Heart Had Wings,2001,"

[Verse 1]
Damn these old wheels
Rolling too slow
I stare down this white line
With so far to go
Headlights keep coming
Loneliness humming along
Who poured this rain?
Who made these clouds??
I stare through this windshield
Thinking out loud
Time keeps on crawling
Love keeps on calling me home
I'd jump all these mountains and take to the skies
Sail through the Heavens with stars in my eyes

[Chorus]
If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

[Verse 2]
We both committed
We both agreed
You do what you have to to get what you need
Feeling you near me with so many miles in between
Lord, it ain't easy out here in the dark
To keep us together so far apart

[Chorus]
If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

[Verse 3]
Stuck on this circle
Spinning around
Cut loose from this rope
That's tying me down

[Chorus]
If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had...
If my heart had wings
I would fly to you and lie
Beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

2022,Tracy Byrd Duet With Mark Chesnutt,26,A Good Way To Get On My Bad Side,2001,"

A little lady standin' next to me
Isn't she a pretty thing?
I'm the one who put that ring on her left hand
Another fella can tip his hat
And I'm as gentle as a pussycat
But let it go much further than that and he's a dead man
'Cause that's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
A politician on my TV
He says he's only lookin' out for me
He says he knows what the poor man needs in the long run
But every year he gives himself a raise
With a chunk of every buck I make
Now he's talkin' like he wants to take my shotgun
Well, that's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
I ain't looking for no trouble
Don't wanna start no fight
Don't want more than I got comin'
I only wanna do what's right
Just treat me like I treat you
And we'll get along just fine
But mister, take one step across that line
And that's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
I like Van Halen and I like George Jones
Charlie Daniels and the Rolling Stones
And Bocephus, when he rocks and rolls still kills me
There ought to be a law against cowboy rap
And all that boy band crap
A little sissy in a cowboy hat ain't country, no
But that's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
Yeah, that's a real good way to get on my bad side
That's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side
That's a good way, that's a real good way
That's a good way to get on my bad side

2023,Darryl Worley,27,Second Wind,2001,"

There's an old friendly breeze that blows
In the Gulf of Mexico
Somehow it always knows
When I'm feeling low

So I'm gonna anchor down
Wait til it comes around
Leave the rest of the world behind
Yeah that's how I'll pass the time

Chorus:
Til I catch my second wind
Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then
When you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

There's a peace in the way I feel
When the water's still
And as long as its calm out here
I've got time to kill
But as soon as it starts to stir
I'll loose track of the way things were
Float away on the open air
I'm not going anywhere

Chorus:
Til I catch my second wind
Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then
When you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

I guess I'll just stay out here
Til I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

Just sit and watch the tide roll in
Til I catch my second wind

2024,Terri Clark,28,No Fear,2001,"

I want a road stretching out before me
I want a radio in my ear
I want a full tank of absolution
No Fear

I want a rainstorm to pull me over
Then a sky that begins to clear
Towards the truest of destinations
No Fear

Chorus:
I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear

I want the world to just keep on turning
I want the dawn in my rearview mirror
I want to hear my own voice singing
No Fear

And when I need two arms around me
And there's no one near
When I'm alone let the only sound be
No Fear

Repeat Chorus

I want peace, love, and understanding
A stogie and an ice-cold beer
Don't wanna live afraid of dying

I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside

I used to stay up all night long
Wondering what I was doing wrong
All I ever needed was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear
No Fear
No Fear

2025,Kenny Rogers,29,There You Go Again,2001,"

There you go again
You take my breath away
The way you looked just then
Moves me more than words can say
Just about the time I think
I couldn't love you any more
Well then, there you go again

You're still amazing me
I shouldn't be surprised
You'd think I'd know by now
But you get me every time
The love you give
Your tender kisses
Take me places I have never been
There you go again

There you go
How'd you know
Sometimes it's like you almost read my mind
Just when I need you most
There you go again

You know it's hard for me
To tell you how I feel
I want you in my life
And I always will
Cause no elxe can touch you
When it comes to lovin' me
The way you can
There you go again

There you go
There you go again...

2026,Lee Ann Womack,30,Why They Call It Falling,2001,"

[Verse 1:]
It's like jumping it's like leaping
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating
It's like flying through the air

It's like soaring
It's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere

[Chorus:]
So why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
Why they call it falling?
I don't know

[Verse 2:]
There was passion
There was laughter
The first morning after
I just couldn't get my feet to touch the ground

Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

[Verse 3:]
It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon

It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new

[Chorus:]
And why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know

Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Now I know

If I'd a-known the way that this would end
If I'd a-read the last page first
If I'd a-had the strength to walk away
If I'd a-known how this would hurt

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

It's bittersweet to look back now
At mem'ries withered on the vine
But just to hold you close to me
For a moment in time

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway

And even if I'd seen it coming
You'd still've seen me running
Straight into your arms

I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I would've loved you anyway

I would've loved you anyway

2028,Blake Shelton,32,Austin,2001,"

[Verse 1]
She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

2029,Phil Vassar,33,Rose Bouquet,2001,"

We were something, you and me
Yeah, we had them rolling in the aisles
We got it right once, didn't we
We had our shot and missed it by a mile
Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then
Do you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw, yeah, we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

2030,Cyndi Thomson,34,What I Really Meant To Say,2001,"

(Cyndi Thomson/Chris Waters/Tommy Lee James)

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say

2031,Sons Of The Desert,35,What I Did Right,2001,"

I have my heroes, but no one knows their names
They never asked for recognition, they never wanted fame
My Granddad fought the second World War
When he was just eighteen
He spent four months as a prisoner
To give me the American dream
In my eyes he's everything, all I hope to be
And I won't forget that day he said he was proud of me

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right

I have my good friends, they have a place inside my heart
But my best friend, well she holds the
Biggest part
She finds the good in me
She knows just what it takes
And she loves the man in me
Through all my mistakes
In my eyes she's everything, everything to me
And I won't forget the day she said
""You're all I need""

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right

And I hold my newborn baby
To give her comfort while she cries
In this moment I feel helpless
'Til she looks into my eyes, her tears subside

So I'll take that one day and figure out what I did right
I'll do it the same way for the rest of my life
What I did right

"
2032,Tammy Cochran,36,Angels In Waiting,2001,"

We camped out on the livin' room floor
In our old sleepin' bags
By a make believe fire
In our tent made of covers
We'd talk for hours
My two brothers and me
Keepin' the faith
Racin' with destiny

Chorus

They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time
'Til time came to leave
Leave them behind
Sweet memories
Angels in waiting
Angels in waiting for wings

2nd Verse

They always knew
They'd never grow old
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul
In their darkest hour
I made a promise
I will always keep
I'll give them life
I'll let them live through me

To have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me...

In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

[Verse 2]
Well, you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

[Chorus]
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

[Bridge]
'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me (You were right there for me)
You were right there for me
For always

[Chorus]
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

[Outro]
There you'll be...

2034,Charlie Robison,38,I Want You Bad,2001,"

Well lately you've been driving me mad
Cause you're the best thing that I've ever had
And I want you
I want you bad

So come on
Let's give it a whirl
And we can shake up
The whole wide world
And I want you
Oh I want you girl

Well I'm running out of things to do
I've got no other place but you

Never no you'll never be sad
I'm gonna make you feel so glad
And I want you
Oh I want you bad

Well I'm running out of things to do
I've got no other place but you

I'm thinking
I'm gonna lose my head
Ya know the phone line
Is taking to much breath
And I want you
Oh I want you bad

Oh and I want you
Oh I want you bad

"
2035,Carolyn Dawn Johnson,39,So Complicated,2001,"

[Verse 1]
I'm so scared that the way that I feel is written all over my face
When you walk into the room
I wanna find a hiding place
We used to laugh
We used to hug
The way that old friends do

But now a smile
And a touch of your hand just makes me come unglued
It's such a contradiction
Do I lie or tell the truth?
Is it fact or fiction?
Oh, the way I feel for you

[Chorus]
It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away
I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay
Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't
It's so complicated

[Verse 2]
Just when I think I'm under control
I think I finally got a grip
Another friend tells me that my name is always on your lips
They say I'm more than just a friend
They say I must be blind
Well, I admit that I've seen you watch me
From the corner of your eye

Oh, it's so confusing
Yeah, I wish you'd just confess
But think of what I'd be losing
If your answer wasn't yes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I hate it
Cause I've waited so long for someone like you
What do I do?
Oh, should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't
It's so complicated

[Outro]
It's so complicated
It's so complicated

2036,SHeDAISY,40,Still Holding Out For You,2001,"

Never thought I'd be in this place
It's someone else's life I'm living
Wish I were living a lie
The hardest part is when the bough breaks
Falling down and then forgiving
You didn't kiss me good-bye
I'm choking on the words I didn't get to say
And pray I get the chance one day

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

I can hear you smile in the dark
I can even feel your breathing
But daylight chases the ghosts
I see your coat and I fall apart
To those hints of you I'm clinging
Now's when I need them most
I should get up, dry my eyes and move ahead
At least that's what you would have said

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

Faithfully, I trace your name while you sleep
It's the the only true comfort I feel

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before

I stil run, I still swing open the door
I still think, you'll be there like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come around
Some things the heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

2037,Toby Keith,41,I'm Just Talkin' About Tonight,2001,"

[Verse 1]
Why'd you have to wear that dress this evening
And those high heels with those buckles on your feet?
I love the way your hair falls down across your shoulders
But you ain't gonna hear that from me

[Verse 2]
You got my heart racing like a freight train
Wishing you and me were somewhere else
I know how good it's gonna be when we get to where we're going
Think I'd better keep it to myself

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

[Verse 3]
Every time we dance we're getting closer
And I'd like too say a thing or two about it
But trust me you don't wanna get me talking
I'm better off just dancing all around it

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

'Cause baby, I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I've had way too much to drink tonight
Oh, this is where I usually say something out of line
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

[Outro]
Oh, the road to love is paid with good intentions
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind
Just be glad that right now you can't read my mind

2038,Mark Wills,42,Loving Every Minute,2001,"

I was never really breathing
My heart was never really beating
Till you held me in your arms
And every love that didn't last
Every second of my past
Simply disappeared into the dark

(chorus)
And with that first kiss I felt my life beginning
And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the magic of that moment is neverending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute

It's the need that never changes
A passion that is ageless
It consumes me like it did when it was new
You have lead me to a place where every day's the same
And I'm always falling more in love with you

(repeat chorus twice)
Oh, and I'm loving every minute
Oh, loving you baby

2039,Diamond Rio,43,Sweet Summer,2001,"

He had a freezer full of bomb pops
Push ups, drum sticks and dreamcicles
And a paint chipped change box
Full of sticky quarters, dimes and nickles
It was automatic when you heard that song
Run home and get your money before he's gone

Lookin' underneath the Chrysler in the driveway
Hey, dad what ya doin'
The smell of summer twilight
There's always somebody barbeque'n
Truth or dare with the kids on our road
Hide and seek till your mama calls you home

Chorus

Sweet summer, yeah I remember that
Sweet summer, let me take you back

Both our moms were best friends
And she was the youngest of three daughters
An angel on a pink Schwinn, my first crush
To this day I ain't forgot her
Those days were never too long
And never too hot
Even though I was out of school
I was learnin' a lot

Chorus

Bridge

There's not a day that I don't remember
From the end of May to the first of September

2040,Trick Pony,44,On A Night Like This,2001,"

[Verse 1]
Now when I was a young girl
My dad warned me about the opposite sex
He'd say, yeah, that's just what you need
Some crazy boy with wild ideas
You know what always happens next
I tried to heed his advice
Now I'm thinkin' it sounds kinda nice

[Chorus]
It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

[Verse 2]
Now my momma told me in this dog-eat-dog world
You gotta work harder than a man
She'd say, yeah that's just what you need
Some romance book Romeo callin' you at work and messin' up your plans
Night falls, I slow down
I start dreamin' of you comin' around

[Chorus]
It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

[Bridge]
Moonlight, sweet bliss
Melting with every kiss
Dancin' real slow
When you hold me close I know

[Chorus]
It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need
Just what I need
Just what I need
Oh yeah

2041,Tracy Lawrence,45,Unforgiven,2001,"

Thomas Jefferson he had slaves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I read about him in the seventh grade
He's forgiven

JFK he loved to run around
He and Norma Jean painted that town
But we know him as a hero now
He's forgiven

(Chorus)
Baby I know I did you wrong
That's why I'm here that's why your gone
I don't know just what I've done
To be one of the unforgiven

I had an uncle he dodged the draft
They said step forward and he stepped back
But we all cut him some slack
He's forgiven

Judas betrayed the christ with a kiss
Cartel kings get a slap on the wrist
Jesse James and Billy the kid
They're all forgiven

(Repeat Chorus)
I've made mistakes, That's what life is
But there ain't a thing I can't live with
And even though you can't forgive
You're forgiven. (END)

2042,Lila McCann,46,Come A Little Closer,2001,"

You look like an angel
I wanna touch you
Come a little closer
There's not much that we can do
Oh unless you
Come a little closer

If you can't see the love in my eyes
If you can't hear my heart beating fast
Then maybe, you should come a little closer
If you can't feel the electricity
Flying between you and me
Then maybe, you should come a little closer

One foot in front of the other
Come a little closer

Right now
One inch between us
Is one too many
Come a little closer
Don't resist it
Too much distance
Are you listening
Come a little closer

If you can't see the love in my eyes
If you can't hear my heart beating fast
Then maybe, you should come a little closer
If you can't feel the electricity
Flying between you and me
Then maybe, you should come a little closer

One foot in front of the other
Come a little closer
Let your heart lead you, I need you
Right here, right now, don't slow down
Keep coming, that's it, come on

Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer

2043,Patty Loveless,47,The Last Thing On My Mind,2001,"

I don't love him anymore
Just ask all my friends
I've told 'em and I tell 'em time and time again
I don't have no regrets
No, I'm not that kind
Honestly, he's the last thing on my mind

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind

Now, rushing through the day
I might seem improved
There isn't time to second-guess my foolish moves
No, I can only see
Once the lights go out
What it is that I can live with and without

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind

When the day turns into dusk
The shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
When I'm drifting off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing
He's the last thing on my mind

You know how words get in my way
It should come easy, I've been rehearsing
I don't know why I'm so afraid, to say
Will you marry me
Put our love and life together
Will you stay with me
For always and forever
On bended knee, would you take this ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me
To be with you is what I live for
But at this moment I confess
Though I love you, God knows I love you
Deep down inside I'm scared to death, say yes
Will you marry me
Put our love and life together
Will you stay with me
For always and forever
On bended knee, would you take this ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me
On bended knee
On bended knee
Would you take this ring
I will take your ring
Will you marry me, please
Will you marry me

Chorus:
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that i'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough
May never have a lot of money, but it don't really matter honey
Love is Enough
Ain't it funny how 4 little letters, can hold it all together
Love is Enough
Even when we're old and gray, i'll be here and you can still hear me say

Long kisses and a tender touch, 2 hearts make a leap
What else do we need?

2046,Andy Griggs,50,How Cool Is That,2001,"

She's the last girl I thought I'd ever see here
But there stands the preacher's daughter holdin' a beer
A tatoo of an angel on the small of her back
How cool.... is that

She probably don't remember me, it's been a long long time
About then she turned around and kinda stared at me and smiled
She said I had the hots for you in Sunday school class
Now tell me how cool.... is that

How cool...... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool...... when no-ones in sight
When I'm the one shes lookin' at with that look in her eye

About then I asked if she was still seein' old what's his name
She said has it really been that long, no... a lot of things have changed
She brushed her hair back and said let's not talk about the past
How cool..... is that

How cool.... is the hot sunlight
When the stars line up and everything feels just right
How cool.... when no-ones in sight
When I'm the one shes lookin' at with that look in her eye

2047,Alan Jackson,1,Drive (For Daddy Gene),2002,"

[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

[Outro]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke

2048,Tommy Shane Steiner,2,What If She's An Angel,2002,"

There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?

What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel?

2049,Steve Azar,3,I Don't Have To Be Me ('til Monday),2002,"

[Verse 1]
I got me a brand new car
Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here

[Verse 2]
So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there

[Pre-Chorus]
Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want
I made up my mind

[Chorus]
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of goin' non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I can do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key
A cash machine, gasoline, and we're outta here

[Pre-Chorus]
Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Baby, you and me
We can leave it all behind

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have to be me 'til Monday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I ain't gonna face reality
Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play

Oh, three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of going non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday

2050,George Strait,4,Living And Living Well,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

2051,Toby Keith,5,My List,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today like

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Chorus 2]
Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today

I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now

[Chorus:]
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

[Verse 2:]
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Dreaming about you
I should be sleeping
Dreaming about you
Well, i'm dreaming about you

Well it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun

And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Woo...

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Pistol pointed at my side

Cause here we go again watching the sun come up

Chorus

I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Because here we go again
Watching the sun come up oh yeah

"
2056,Lonestar,10,Not A Day Goes By,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

[Verse 2]
I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, with your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

[Bridge]
Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Oh, somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by
That I don't think of you

2057,Phil Vassar,11,That's When I Love You,2002,"

(Phil Vassar, Julie Wood)

When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you

"
2058,Gary Allan,12,The One,2002,"

[Verse 1]
No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found, girl

[Chorus]
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one

[Verse 2]
Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl

[Chorus]
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one

[Verse 3]
Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm ""the one""

[Chorus]
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one

"
2059,Kenny Chesney,13,Young,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

[Verse 2]
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

2060,Kellie Coffey,14,When You Lie Next To Me,2002,"

Oh

Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
Oh lie next to me

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

When you lie next to me

2061,Rascal Flatts,15,I'm Movin' On,2002,"

[Verse 1]
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once, I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame
Trapped in the past for too long

[Chorus]
I'm movin' on

[Verse 2]
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong

[Chorus]
I'm movin' on

[Verse 3]
I'm movin' on
At last I can see (At last I can see)
Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

[Verse 4]
I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road

[Chorus]
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on

2062,Trick Pony,16,Just What I Do,2002,"

[Intro]
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
Just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
Hit it
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Jesse James was an outlaw man
He was always breakin' the law
Six guns firing from both his hands
Fastest you ever saw
Did he do it for the money
Or was it for the fame
Finally somebody asked him
Jesse, why you wanna rob them trains
And Jesse said

[Chorus]
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the meanest hombre you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do

[Verse 2]
Well Orville Wright
Set his sights
High up in the air
Him and Wilbur worked day and night
He didn't seem to care
Well the town folk said if you were meant to fly
God would have given you wings
What makes you want to spend all of your time
Building that flying machine
And Orville said

[Chorus]
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the first fly-boy you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
Ooh yeah

[Bridge]
Well Picasso painted them pictures
There was beauty in every stroke
When asked about his motivation
He said, I think it's about time you should know

[Chorus]
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
I'm the workinest painter that you ever saw
'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all
It's just what I do
It's just what I do
Oh yeah
It's just what I do
It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'

2063,Brooks & Dunn,17,My Heart Is Lost To You,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe it was the moonlight
The scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger
Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert
Into my soul

[Chorus]
Mi Corzon perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh my heart is lost to you

[Verse 2]
Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment
That hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away

[Chorus]

"
2064,Tammy Cochran,18,I Cry,2002,"

I don't miss you like I used to
I've pulled your pictures from the wall
I go just where and when I want to
I'm better off now, all in all

My heart ain't broken
It's through aching
And I'm movin on...

CHORUS:
But I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry

I used to hear your ghost calling
You'd never let me go to sleep
You always got your way now darling
But you won't get the best of me any longer
I'm stronger, I'm free...

CHORUS

Still I cry a little bit everyday
At least one teardrop falls
It doesn't matter rain or shine
I try to leave it all behind
I swear that I'm alright
But in the middle of the night I cry
I cry
I cry

2065,Martina McBride,19,Blessed,2002,"

[Verse 1]
I get kissed by the sun
Each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the
Bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my
Front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place

[Chorus]
I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

[Verse 2]
Across a crowded room
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know

2066,Chris Cagle,20,I Breathe In  I Breathe Out,2002,"

Lately I've been runnin' into our old friends
Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, Oh, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

2067,Darryl Worley,21,I Miss My Friend,2002,"

I miss the look of surrender in your eyes
The way your soft brown hair would fall
I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
But baby most of all

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss the colors that you brought into my life
Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes
I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now
Saying it'll be alright

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss those times
I miss those nights
I even miss the silly fights
The making up
The morning talks
And those late afternoon walks

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with

2068,Andy Griggs,22,Tonight I Wanna Be Your Man,2002,"

Baby light a couple candles, lock the bedroom door
Put on some sweet soul music, throw a blanket on the floor
Surrender to my patient hands
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

It hit me just this morning, when I passed you in the hall
I swear I caught you lookin, like you dont know me at all
Let me show you who I am
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

And I'll always be, your cover when your cold
And when the world winds up against you, im the safe place you can go
But now and then, we need to find some time to be in love, just be in love

Now the whole worlds in bed sleepin, I think were finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringin, we'll pretend like were not home
Cause any fool would understand
That all week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

Mhhmh, mmhmmmhm

So let me show you who I am
All week ive been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man

Just forget about that old wedding band
All week I've been your husband, tonight I wanna be your man
Mmmhmm

[Verse 1]
Once, in a lifetime
You'll open up your heart
Maybe once, in your lifetime
You'll swear to never be apart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You think your love's on solid ground
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down

[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop

Somebody help me understand

And my picture, in your locket
What will you do with it now
All our friends, and all our memories
Tell me how we sort them out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine
Is that all that's left, after all this time

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely

'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me

Help me understand
Why I'm not part of our plan
And you don't need me anymore
Help me understand
Why I still want to be where you are
Even though I know in my hear
You don't love me anymore

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feelin' lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop

2071,Sara Evans,25,I Keep Looking,2002,"

[Verse 1:]
Back when I was young
Couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home, yea
When my low self esteem
Needs a man loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends
Having wild weekends
Then I don't wanna get quite so attached
Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied
Good is good but could be better

[Chorus:]
I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking
Looking for something more

[Verse 2:]
Well, the straight haired girls
They all want curls
And the brunettes wanna be blonde
It's your typical thing
You got ying you want yang
It just goes on and on
They say, hey, it's only human
To never be satisfied
Well I guess that I'm as human as the next one

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied
Hey, good is good but could be better

2072,Brad Martin,26,Before I Knew Better,2002,"

No one thought that I'd jump off that rocky ledge
So I did, and I broke my leg
And I let Jim beam tell me I could take some guy
Twice my size, but old Jim lied
I can't pretend that I ain't been my life's own wrecking crew
And I'm surprised that I've survived all I put myself through

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I did a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better

You were the first to ever make me wanna change
My reckless ways and I almost did
But somehow I lost track and wound up giving in
To the late night life and the good time friends
You swore to me one day you'd leave and all I had to say
Was there's the door what you waiting for
And who need you anyway

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I said a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better

Girl I pray somehow, someway
We can turn this thing around
I thought your love was something
I could live without, before I knew

Before I knew better, before I woke up
I said a whole lotta crazy foolish things I'm not proud of
It was just like me to risk it all
Even when the pain outweighed the pleasure
Before I knew better, before I knew better
Before I knew better, before I knew better

2073,Mark Chesnutt,27,She Was,2002,"

She started her new life ten dollars in debt
That's all it took to get started back then
A trip to the courthouse across the state line
No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind
He was eighteen, she wasn't

But she said she was and never thought twice
Came back home as my daddy's wife
She just shook her head when her momma said
""Are you sure he's the one?"" She was

He took a job and farmed on the side
He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied
Changes were coming to their little world
She said ""What would you like, a boy or a girl?""
He said ""Are you?""

She said she was and never thought twice
'Bout takin the next step in building their lives
Soon there were three and she tried to be
Everything to us And she was

Those precious moments turned into years
In what seemed like the blink of an eye
I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her
""Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?""

She said she was but she thought twice
Holdin' my hand as she let go of life
Daddy always said a woman like her
Would be hard to give up
And she was

She was

If there ever was a picture of love
She was

2074,Shannon Lawson,28,Goodbye On A Bad Day,2002,"

You slipped off your wedding band
And tucked it deep inside my hand
Forced a smile and headed towards the door
And as you walked out, I heard you say

""Things just haven't been going our way
And I don't love you anymore""
Now, after the day I had
I could have done without that

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and watch you walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day

I've seen that look, I can always tell
It means ""Stay away from me and go straight to Hell""
That's exactly where I'll be when you're gone
And after a day like this my whole world's gone

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and watch you walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day

Oh, you're the one thing I have left
When the whole world holds me down
Now, how can I keep going
When you're not around?

I'd rather watch the house we built burn to the ground
And stand out in the pouring rain, let the good Lord strike me down
Than to sit here and have my whole world walk away
Anything would be better than your goodbye on a bad day

2075,Tracy Byrd,29,Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo,2002,"

[Verse 1]
When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus

[Chorus]
But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin 'long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

[Verse 2]
Then some stranger asked me dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said, ""Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an ol' memory""

[Chorus]
Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before

[Bridge]
Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

[Chorus]
After nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out and I was about to give in
The after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started countin' again!

[Outro]
One round with Jose Cuervo
I went two rounds with Jose Cuervo
Three rounds with Jose Cuervo
Five rounds with Jose Cuervo or was it four?
Six rounds with Jose Cuervo
Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo
Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...

2076,Blake Shelton,30,Ol' Red,2002,"

[Verse 1]
Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Aren’t nobody got past Red

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 2]
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 3]
Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out

So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff""

[Verse 1]
My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

[Pre-Chorus]
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Verse 2]
Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again

[Pre-Chorus]
But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Bridge]
So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Verse 1]
Going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
And I need a shave

[Verse 2]
I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says, ""Son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style"", and from behind my coffee cup
I just smile

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh

[Verse 3]
This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm losing my mind, I swear; it might be the death of me
But I don't care

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh

[Bridge]
Is it your eyes is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
(What a beautiful)
What a beautiful...

[Chorus]
What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh
Ahhh

2080,Little Big Town,34,Don't Waste My Time,2002,"

[Verse 1]
I've been here before
It only made me cry
I felt so sure
I never questioned why
Till I woke up alone
That's why I have to ask you
Baby what's behind your kiss
I need to know your heart's in this

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the kind of love
That is strong enough
To walk through anything
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
I only  want to play for keeps
Want to fall in deep
If you don't just say goodbye
Don't waste my time

[Verse 2]
The words you say
Are what I want to hear
Promises you make
Are music to my ears
Is it the heat of the moment talking
Promises come easily
Give me something to believe

Time, time, time, time

Tone deaf, tone deaf

Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh
Da da da da da da

You say you're gun shy
I say you're spineless
You think you're pensive
I think you're mindless
Such a busy little drone
That your heart beats in monotones
So loud you can't hear me
Repetition's what you need

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Ahh-ahh, da da da da da da da da

You say you're complicated
I say too dramatic
You think I underrate you
I think I've finally had it
With you never having time
'Cause half the time you spend
Designing brilliant tragedies
And it's becoming your disease, oh

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Won't let you unnerve me
(You try to sting me like a pearl)
Won't let you deserve me
(And toss me from your tilt-o-whirl)
And even if I kiss the dirt you're gonna see
How I don't hurt
And I don't hurt
I don't hurt

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Um, let me give you a tip, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Get out of my air, get off my cloud
Get out of my hair, get off of my couch
Get off of my lips, get out of my light
Get over yourself, get out of my sight
Get off of your knees, get out of my face
Get out of my sleep, get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell, scream and yell
Get over yourself

Get over yourself

I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base
With a secondhand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere, Virginia
Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far

It was 419 Lakewood, had no silver spoons
Just an old beat-up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings, I thank God I was an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

My grandfather would have been eighty today
But in '45 he fell down beside an American child

An American child
Oh, an American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child
Oh, an American child

2086,Martina McBride,40,Where Would You Be,2002,"

I wonder where your heart is
Cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish
That I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong
Have you felt this way long
Are you already gone

Do you feel lonely
When you're here by my side
Does the sound of freedom
Echo in your mind
Do you wish you were by yourself
Or that I was someone else
Anyone else

(Chorus)
Where would you be
If you weren't here with me
Where would you go
If you were single and free
Who would you love
Would it be me
Where would you be

I don't wanna hold you back
No, I don't wanna slow you down
I don't wanna make you feel
Like you are tied up and bound
Cause that's not what love's about
If there's no chance we can work it out
Tell me now
Oh tell me tell me now

(Repeat Chorus)
Have I become the enemy
Is it hard to be yourself
In my company

(Repeat Chorus)
Oh tell me tell me now
Where would you be
Where would you go
Who would you love
Would it be me?

[Intro]
American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue

I can remember,like it was yesterday
When daddy sold his Corvair and we watched it drive away
Well,then we walked down the corner with the money that he got
He bought a Mr. Cruiser off of Mr.Kelly's lot
Well,that station wagon was the ugliest thing around
And I'd hide beneath the dashboard everytime we drove through town
Now,21 years later,(21 years later)I got a wife and kid
And I'm standin' here on Kelly's lot,just like my daddy did
And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Sellin' that four by four really hurt my pride
But the cold,hard fact was the lack of room inside
Well,so long to my gone good days,I don't cruise for chicks no more
Now it's luggage racks,and fruit juice packs,and an extra slidin' door
And I'm singin'
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys in my hand
I've got the keys in my pocket
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
I can see us on the highway,baby's fast asleep
Momma reads a book and I'm in the driver's seat
Headin' off to places we never been before
With everything I need and room for more
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan
Look out 30's,I'm becoming my old man
The keys are in my pocket
Yeah,I've got the title in my hand
Goodbye 20's,hello minivan

Crank it

Where she grew up, there ain't no roads
Out in the sticks where the ginseng grows
She'd float down the river to get to school
Then her daddy'd come get her on an old pack mule
She run back and forth from shed to shack
Checkin' on the moonshine brewin' out back
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

Chorus:
She got a bible; she's born again
She got a shotgun; she ain't afraid of sin
She got rebel-rousin', rowdy friends singin', whoa whoa whoa
She got a Trans Am, with a trailer hitch
She got horses, cows and Dixie Chicks
Goes honky-tonkin' just for kicks
If that ain't country
I don't know what is

She plants fifty acres with seed an' a hoe
Come Fall, you get lost in the tall corn rows
Don't need no phone where she come from;
She just holler down the mountain and the boys all run.(Fast)
You might see her truck rollin' outta the woods
With a 12 point buck laid across the hood
If you don't get the picture by now
Then wait a minute

If we dare to dream
All in the name of romance...

We're sill young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything

We'll find a place on a cliff by the ocean
And pay a couple months' rent
I'll sell my paintings down by the board walk
So we'll have money to spend...

We're still young and in love

We can be strong and do anything

Dare to dream, take it to the extreme
Let your heart and soul lead the way
Live, Love, seize the day and
Dare to dream, dare to dream, dare to dream

Don't try to stop us don't tell us we're crazy

Cool, cool time, hangin' out with the boys
An AM radio making some noise
Tunin' in to a moment in time
When everything seemed like the perfect rhyme
Here it is. Here I go. My show. Can't wait
Gotta do it now 'fore it gets too late

Hey, man, look at me now
Nothing in the world's gonna get me down
Sparks fly, I'm on fire:
Way up high, and I'm getting higher
Turn it loose; turning it on
On a day like this
What could go wrong?
Tip my hat, blow a kiss to the crowd
(Hey, man, look at me now.)

Green grass growing on the edge of my feet
Feels good knowing I'm not out of my league
Singing a song that I never have sung;
Out of my reach on the tip of my tongue
Who knows if tomorrow will come
It really don't matter 'til this day's done
Gotta move. Gotta go. My fate. My turn
Still a little daylight left to burn
(Still a little daylight left to burn.)

Hey, man, look at me now

Hot sun goin' down
Heatin' up this little town
The cows are fed and the plowin's all been done
Moonlight, fireflies
Beer on the bank by the riverside
We're gonna have ourselves a little fun

Dancin' on the tailgates
And raisin' a little cane
Rockin' in the pastures
And rollin' in the hay

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born
And Country by the grace of God

I don't need no Cadillacs
You can't put no hay bails on the back
It won't cross a creek
Or tow no heavy load
I don't like a high-rise
Cluttering up my clear blue skies
Don't wanna be where the city's all that grows

Some are born with a silver spoon
And some come from the farm
Some have a ball in the mansion
But we get down in the barn

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born

On a big ol' piece of land
We're free to do anything we like
We're country so we can

Well, a hammer fell down on a .44 primer
And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight
Wrong or right

She just looked to me as she finished her tale
The blank expression went another pale shade of gray
There was nothing to say

In the shadows of her face I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said

""Don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat.""
""Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet.""
""There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play.""

Well, I put the cuffs on her and sat her in the car
Walked inside, he was layin' on the floor stone dead
Been shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by the chair
A starving baby with nothing to wear but tears
So the picture was clear

He had finally pushed her way across the line
And the badge I wore was losing all its shine
And she said

""Don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat.""
""Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet.""
""There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play.""

I just stood there thinkin' how justice is blind
But after thirty five years you learn to read the signs
So I made up my mind

I took the cuffs oof her and I walked her back in
Wiped the gun off and wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper read in black and white
It's just another senseless case of suicide
Suicide

Oh, but don't you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug it off until you've walked a mile along my beat
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

Well, a hammer fell down on a .44 Primer
And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight...

Have I got the deal for you

Would you like to have a t-bone steak and lobster
Served on the finest china
Accompanied by a bottle of the world's greatest wine
Served in a crystal glass
Alone
Or would you rather have
A Big Mac, an order of fries, a cherry pie
Underneath a big oak tree
Sittin' on a blanket
Snuggled up with the one you love

CHORUS
I'll talk love over money
Forget the green, give me honey
Some people work work work their lives away
But I'll take love over money
Any day

Okay check this out
You're on the streets of Paris
Standing underneath the Ifle Tower
Surrounded by all the magical things the City of Romance has to offer
But you're all alone
Or would you rather be at the state fair
Standing in line for the Tilt-A-Whirl
Eatin' cotton candy
MMMM that's good
Drinking a Dr. Pepper
And stealing a kiss from the one you love

CHORUS

Okay now think about this
That's it, a low flowin', red slick, candy apple
Rockin' sled of a Farrari
Price tag 205 and some change
But no one and I mean absolutely no one will ever be in the passenger seat with you
Or would you rather have a 1989
Mud gray 150 extended cab with 4 wheel drive
And sittin' right next to you as close as the law will allow
Chewing bubble gum, singin' in your ear
Along with Lynyrd Skynyrd
Is the one you love

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die, your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends, if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe
Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever in the heart of me
I would hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most

See that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe
Oh, I believe

There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And I believe

"
2098,Randy Travis,2,Three Wooden Crosses,2003,"

[Verse 1]
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Verse 2]
That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom
In the minds of lots of children:
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered:
""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained bible
In that hooker's hand

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Bridge]
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up
For all of us to see
He said: ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' the preacher;
Who gave this Bible to my mamma
Who read it to me.""

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Outro]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway

2099,Keith Urban,3,Raining On Sunday,2003,"

[Verse 1]
It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

[Chorus]
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

[Chorus]
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain

Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th Avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on Day Fourteen
And Day Sixty-Seven she said ""I love you"" to me

Chorus:
Oh, what a feeling

Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh, I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said ""I do"" on day Four Eighty Two
And gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One

Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way

All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

[Verse 1]
I have always been a little shy
I've always been the quiet type 'till now
I-I-I, I never let my feelings show
I never let anybody know just how
Much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

[Verse 2]
You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt
And I-I-I, I don't think I can resist
But I've never been one to kiss and tell
Our love this true, can't be subdued
So I'm gonna let out a yell

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

Baby, I want the whole world to see

I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video

I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you
Baby, I love to love you out loud

I love to love you out loud

2103,Darryl Worley,7,Have You Forgotten?,2003,"

I hear people sayin'. We Don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?!

2104,Lonestar,8,My Front Porch Looking In,2003,"

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Bridge]
I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)

2105,Tim McGraw,9,She's My Kind Of Rain,2003,"

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

[Verse 1]
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Verse 2]
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain

2106,Kenny Chesney,10,Big Star,2003,"

[Verse 1]
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2]
She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers

[Verse 3]
She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear their certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going unless you got something they have not got

[Outro]
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus and the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us
She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star

2107,Jimmy Wayne,11,Stay Gone,2003,"

I've found piece of mind
I'm feeling good again
I'm on the other side
Back among the living
Ain't a cloud in the sky
All my tears have been cried
And I can finally say

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I still love you
And I will forever
We can't hide the truth
We know each other better
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

So Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
Oh, In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone...

[Verse 1]
He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, ""Old man are you OK?""

[Chorus]
He said, ""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home""

[Verse 2]
Then he said, ""I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, ""Son, hurry up""
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been""

[Chorus]
""Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home""

[Bridge]
I said ,""Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission""
He said, ""Boy, if you'd've left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'""

[Chorus]
""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze

2109,Montgomery Gentry,13,Speed,2003,"

I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch

Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

That's what I need
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I'm tired of spinning my wheels

2110,Jeff Bates,14,The Love Song,2003,"

First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold

Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove

And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...

Where you from?
What's your name?
Wanna go to my game?
Got the keys to my dad's old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love....

The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasn't livin for myself

I knew i wasn't fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more...
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do...

Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldn't talk
Couldn't breathe...
My heart had me all choked up
Said ""I do,""
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love....

Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said ""It's time to watch your miracle arrive.""

Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love......

2111,Brooks & Dunn,15,Red Dirt Road,2003,"

[Verse 1]
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Bridge]
I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends

He wore that cowboy hat to cover up his horns
Sweet talking forked tongue, had a tempting charm
Before I turned around that girl was gone
All I can say is, bartender pour me something strong

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

It was long and chrome, sitting in the lot
Fire engine red, that thing was hot
He reved it up, she waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell and so have I

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill

We don't like to go out shopping
We don't care what's on sale
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
Watchin the NFL
When you come over at half time
And say does this dress fit too tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say ""uh uh it looks just right""

Well, thats the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss

And no matter what line we hand you
When we come dragging in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We hate watchin Steel Magnolias
We like Rambo and Die Hard 4
Jump up and down like fools
When we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store

We don't really wanna take you to dinner
At some fancy resturaunt
The only reason we do is cause
We know it leads too the one thing
That we all want

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Then work on the problems in our lives

And though we might say it to you
Every now and then
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinking
It's nothing to complex
It's just some thing cold for drinking
And a whole lot of S.E.X

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit
And a whole lot of other disgusting stuff

And no matter what line we give you
When we come crawling in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen
Sure it's gonna happen
You know it's gonna happen again

And that's the truth about men

If money grew on hackberry trees

A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail

Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad

Smell in the wind
Tell me something bad about Tulsa
So I won't have to go back
Believing I belong there
Again

I kept getting lost in when I met her
Hair like Oklahoma sand

But all good things must end
All rivers have to bend
I keep running out
But she keeps pulling me back in

Thinking I was better off
'Cuz you were mine
You always said
It was your way or the highway

So I'm shifting my life into drive
I'm getting out
Kissing the past good-bye
Like Toby said
""How do you like me now?""
This conversation has run dry
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

I'm not saying
I'm battered and bruised
But I might as well be with the words you used
I believe in myself
That makes me stronger
Things changed
And so have I

I'm gonna make hay while the sun still shines
You can clip my wings
But I'm still gonna fly
I'm on my own and on my way
And I keep telling myself

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

There was always something
That meant more to you than me
And I'm just sorry
It's taking this for you to see

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
There's more to me than you
Ooooooo, ooooooo
Don't underestimate what I can do

Well, I'm alright
It's okay
I know I'll make it through
'Cuz there's more to me than you

Ooooooooo, ooooooo, oooooo
There's more to me than you

There's more to me than you

"
2117,Brad Paisley,21,Celebrity,2003,"

[Verse 1]
Someday I'm going to be famous, do I have talent, well no
These days you don't really need it thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel, can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab

[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity

[Verse 2]
I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up

[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity

[Bridge]
So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of the fun and the sun
We'll be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
Hey hey, Hollywood, here we come

[Chorus]
Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV
Being a celebrity
Yeah celebrity

2118,Jo Dee Messina,22,Was That My Life,2003,"

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the one who's old before their time
And lose the wonder that I felt as a child
I can't run this race believing I might lose
There's still so much to see and so much left to do
Yes, I'll fall before I fly
But no one can say I never tried

[Chorus]
Oh, we just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast, but one day we look back
And we ask, ""Was that my life?""

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been
To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them
All those sunny days and all those starry skies
Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights
Oh, I can't tell them enough
Just how much that they are loved

[Chorus]
Oh, you just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast that one day we look back
And we ask, ""Was that my life?""
We just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast that one day we look back
And we ask, ""Oh, was that my life?""

[Outro]
""Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by?""
Rollin', rollin', rollin, rollin' on by
Was that my life?
Mmmhmm
Was that my life?

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, in your arms
Ohh
I can hear your heartbeat now

In your arms
I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms

Oh, yeah
Wanna wake up every morning, yeah

[Verse 3]
In your eyes (I can still see the look of the one)
I can still see the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) I can still see love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)

[Pre-Chorus]
And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always

Oh
I'm keeping you forever
Got to keep you, baby
Forever
In your arms

You don't know what you do to me
You changed around the scenery
And now everything is new to me
But it looks just right,yeah it looks just right
Whoa,it's strange but it's beautiful
Yeah,and I know where I am

Oh,I never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin',stumblin' over the words that get tangled inside of me
I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure I've never been here before

I'm walkin' in a wonderland
Gone ever since it all began
And I don't even want to understand
'Cause it feels that good,yeah it feels that good
It's a state that ain't on a map
Yet I know where I'm at

Oh,I've never been here before

2121,Trace Adkins,25,Then They Do,2003,"

[Verse 1]
In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirt-tail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
""Stop worrying about your hair, you look fine""
Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's got to go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait until they grow up

[Chorus]
Then they do, and that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe how much you miss
All they do and all they did
You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
Then they do

[Verse 2]
Now the youngest is starting college
She'll be leaving in the Fall
And Brianna's latest boyfriend
Called to ask if we could talk
And I got the impression
That he's about to pop the question any day
I look over at their pictures
Sitting in their frames
I see them as babies
I guess that'll never change
You pray all their lives
That someday they will find happiness

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
No more Monday PTA's
No carpools, or soccer games
Your work is done
Now you've got time that's all your own
You've been waiting for so long
For those days to come

Ah, then they do

2122,Sara Evans,26,Backseat Of A Greyhound Bus,2003,"

[Verse 1:]
She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
In a town this small all they do is talk
No wedding ring, chipped fingernail polish

She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade
They just slip away
She started to show a few months ago
And she had to go
That's how she wound up

[Chorus:]
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Head hung down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus

[Verse 2:]
The moon was full
The stars were smiling
God has a funny sense of timing
The baby came on the interstate
Somewhere between Jackson and Memphis

She finally found what she had been missing
She cried and laughed while the red lights flashed
Sweet baby girl
She looked into the face of a new
The face of a brand new world

[Chorus x2:]
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace

But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Sweet baby girl, she found a brand new world

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace

But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Sweet baby girl
She found a brand new world

She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted

What The World Needs Now Is Love
What The World Needs
I look around at all the faces and I see
All the lonely people looking back at me
Rich, poor don't matter we're all the same
Everybody's hungry in a different way
We're clawin' and climbin' and kickin' and screamin' and fightin' but really

[Chorus]
What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day
Let's come together
Lay our differences down
Spread it all around
That's what the world needs now
(La, la, la, la, la)
Sometimes all it takes is just a smile
To change somebody's weather
Chase the clouds out of their sky
Sometimes you gotta give and not receive
Sometimes you gotta live what you believe
Open your arms cause that's where it starts
Right here with you and with me

[Bridge]
Nobody likes the cold
We all need someone to hold
No one wants to be alone

2124,Dusty Drake,28,One Last Time,2003,"

When she picked up the telephone
His voice came on the line
She said, ""This can't be happening""
And tears fell from her eyes
She said, ""What am I supposed to do?
I can't handle losing you""
He said, ""I just had to call and say goodbye
One last time""

He said, ""There are some things in this life
That are out of our control
Like who we fall in love with
And when it's time to go""
She said, ""What about the plans we had?""
He said, ""This connection's getting bad
Now come on, baby, let me hear you smile
One last time""

She started to apologize
For all the things that she'd done wrong
She said, ""I would have loved you better
If only I had known""
He said, ""You were the perfect wife
Promise me you'll go on with your life""
She said, ""The boys won't understand""
He said, ""Tell them daddy loves them and
Be strong,"" whoa

He said, ""Hun, I've gotta go""
She said, ""Don't you dare hang up
There's so many things I need to say
I love you so much""
It was almost like she felt him leave
She cried out, ""Can you still hear me?""
She fell down on the kitchen floor
When the signal died
As the pilot tried to pull out of the dive
One last

2125,Clay Walker,29,A Few Questions,2003,"

How in this world
Can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need
For a place like St. Judes
And why is one man born
In a place where all they know is war
A guy like me
Has always been free

And how can two people
Who built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
And somewhere out there tonight
There is a baby no ones holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up

But I wasn't there the day you filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

And why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid
Only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
What do I know

I wasn't there the day You filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see You hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess You
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

Why do I feel like
You hear these prayers of mine
When so many outta be
Ahead of me in line
When you look down on me
Can you see the good through all the bad
These are just a few questions I had

2126,Amy Dalley,30,Love's Got An Attitude (It Is What It Is),2003,"

Stumbled to Bongo Java for a cup
They're out of my favorite beans: ain't that my luck?
The heater in my car's blowin' cold
Got my divorce attorney on the 'phone
Says: ""Girl, I got your paper's ready.""
It's the 14th of February
An' all my girlfriend's got roses

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on; it'll turn on you
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress;
It's a tattoo you wake up with
But love ain't gonna make sense
It is what it is

Kroeger has exactly what I need:
Ben and Jerry's and People magazine
Walkin' in slow motion down my aisle
It's a stranger with a ""C'mon, get you some"" smile
He's so GQ, he could be gay
His pick up line's borderline lame;
But he's a pilot an' that's hot

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on; it'll turn on you
It's a sacred song in a wedding dress;
It's a tattoo you wake up with
But love ain't gonna make sense
It is what it is

Instrumental break

Love's really got an attitude
It'll turn you on, it'll turn on you
If you have it, you can't hide it
If you want it, you can't find it
Thinking only complicates it
You can lose it, you can make it
But it ain't ever gonna make sense
It is what it is

Love's really got an attitude

You look so peaceful sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving but I'm gone
Well I did my best to beat 'em, but in my head the demons said move on
When you wake up you're gonna curse my name
But as some time goes by I hope and pray

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

I think about the night I met you
I swore I'd never forget you, well I won't
I think about the way you live and breathe beside my dreams forever
Well you'll be better when I'm gone
Cuz I know you're gonna fall in love again
I'm sorry this is how it has to end

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way I love you
When you think of me

As I pick up these bags and turn around
I say a little prayer and hope somehow

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be
Remember the times I held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

When you think of me
Remember the way that i used to be
Remember the times i held you tenderly
Remember the way that I love you

When you think of me
When you think of me
When you think of me
When you think of me

[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

[Verse 1]
I can hear
That highway calling
As I watch the sunrise
Crawling across her shoulder
This is usually goodbye
And yet those words
I just can't find here
As I hold her
She's like no other woman
That I have known before
And it ain't me to
See the morning sun
From this side of the door

[Chorus]
Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gone?
How does she hold me
Without holding on?
In love or a fight
She's stronger than strong
Something's not right
If there ain't nothing wrong
It's got me wondering
Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gona?

[Verse 2]
All those words
I left behind me
Praying they would never
Find me and my freedom
But if they stood
Right here beside me
They would never recognise me
For all that she's done

Once happiness was only
Whenever I was on my own
So now why do I feel lonely
Any time that I'm alone

No, they've never built
A wall that high
Or made a chain that strong
And God ain't never
Made a place
I felt like I belong

So, you lit her cigarette
You're feeling pretty good
You think you've got a shot
Most girls, you probably would
Yeah, this is that kind of place
But she ain't that kind of girl
You're reading it all wrong
Let me tell you about her

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

Did you ask her to dance?
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her someplace quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard
When she smiles and turns you down
For a complicated girl
She ain't that hard to figure out

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

Oh, she only smokes when she drinks

As I give up on this day
Wonderin' if I'll ever find someone
When I close my eyes and dream
There are words I'm whispering
Someday love will come
I won't have a doubt
My head up in the clouds
And certain as the morning sun
I will always believe
There's somebody just for me
Someday love will come

Someday
After all these nights of waiting
And someday
I'll find a chance worth taking
Saving me
From wakin' up alone
My heart will find a home
Someday

The sweetest miracle
Someday love will come

The moment was custom-made to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul

She said
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?

And I sat there on the shoulder

Often takes me by surprise like

Lean on me, my back aren’t breaking
All I'm saying is

[Chorus]
I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting

[Verse 4]
Honey, I aren’t quitting
I'm always giving
My everything

[Bridge]
Yeah

[Outro]
As long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting
Yeah

2135,Travis Tritt,39,Country Ain't Country,2003,"

He was raised on a tractor in overalls and boots
Been to college and then law school since leaving his roots
Came home in a Lexus, he left in a Ford
Country ain't country no more

He told his daddy catch up with the times
He said now a days people trade heifers online
Dad ain't sealing deals with a handshake like before
Country ain't country no more
No, country ain't country no more

The back forty was sold to make up for hard times
Then sold by the half acre lot overnight
The houses went up and the trees were cut down
And there went the finest deer hunting around
Lord, everyone's locking their doors
'Cause country ain't country no more

Now his dad sits in traffic looking 'round at the change
Watching crews turn the county road into four lanes
The old Sunday drive has turned into a chore
Country ain't country no more
Lord, country ain't country no more

The back forty was sold to make up for hard times
Then sold by the half acre lot overnight
The houses went up and the trees were cut down
And there went the finest deer hunting around
Lord, everyone's locking their doors
'Cause country ain't country no more

There's no turning back
And you just can't ignore
That country ain't country no more
No, country ain't country no more...

Country certainly isn't country anymore...
Thanks to Kerry. VOTE Bush!!!

[Verse 1]
I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of getting away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems

[Verse 2]
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!

[Outro]
Babe let's get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems

2137,Emerson Drive,41,Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You),2003,"

[Verse 1:]
We saw the moon in Colorado
Made music in Tennessee
We found the gold of El Dorado
It's so good, making love, you and me
These arms, they will never hold another
These eyes, they are blind to any other

[Pre-Chorus:]
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss
This heart, it will always feel like this 'cause

[Chorus:]
Only God could stop me loving you
Only God could tell me not to
He sent you from Heaven
Just to make my dreams come true
When he opened the door
That you came walking through
Only God could stop me loving you

[Verse 2:]
Now we struck oil in Oklahoma
And we won the Oscar in Hollywood
We climbed the canyons of Arizona
And baby, making love never felt so good
These lips, no other girl will ever kiss
This heart, it will always feel like this 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
There ain't no girl
In the whole wide world
Who could take away my heart
& there ain't no man to steal your
Hand & tear us apart
But there is one god in heaven above
Who gave me love strong enough
To cam my heart
Cause' Only God could stop me from loving you
Only God could tell me not too

2138,Faith Hill,42,You're Still Here,2003,"

[Chorus]
Thought I saw you today
You were standing in the sun abd then you turned away

[Verse]
And I knew I couldn't be, but my heart believed
Oh, it seems like something everyday
How could you be so far away
When you're still here?
When I need you, you're not hard to find
You're still here
I can see you in my baby's eyes
And I laugh and cry
You're still here
I dreamed last night
That you came to me on silver wings of light
I flew away with you in the painted sky
And I woke up wondering what was real
Is it what you see and touch or what you feel?
Because you're still here
Oh, you're everywhere we've ever been
You're still here
I heard you in a stranger's laugh
And I hunger on to hear your laugh again
Just once again

[Chorus]
Oh
Thought I saw you today
You were standing in the sun and then you turned away
Away

How cool is Air Force one?
Are those guys in the house and the senate
Ever gonna get anything done?
I ain't no Democrat

We're wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance
At our daughters' weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land

How 'bout that money I sent?
Must take a lot of port barrels
Just to run the government
Hey, Mr. President
Our kids in the Middle East
I guess you gotta fight sometimes
To find a way to keep the peace
I ain't no Democrat
I ain't no Republican
Were fathers and mothers
Sisters and brothers
Wives and husbands
And we pray that we dance
At our daughters' weddings
And our sons grow to fine men
And for peace on our land
I cannot imagine
How hard it must be
To tell some soldier's mother
They died for their country
Mr. President, won't you thank her for me?
Hey, Mr. President
Do you ever feel alone?
Surrounded by all those ghosts in the White House
Bet you wish you could move back home
We ain't just Democrats
We ain't just Republicans
It's all for one and one for all
We're all Americans
And we pray that we see our children's children
And our sons grow to old men
And for peace, yeah, peace on our land

Well Bobby had everything
He thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car
And a master's degree
Still he's feelin lost
With no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
It says ""Change your kids' life with just a couple hours a week""
Normally he'd keep clicking
Just surfin around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh it's amazing
How love changes everything..

Well Sarah does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left
It's hard to find the strength
She wipes the tear from her eye
As she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cuz after dinner, baths and homework
There's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids
Too tired to fight
No money, no romance
No end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says
""I Love You Mom""
Oh it's amazing
How love changes everything

[Verse 1]
This might come as quite a shock
But I've given it a lot of thought
This thing that's come between us can't be ignored
I've taken all I can
And this is where it's gotta end
'Cause I can't be your friend anymore

[Verse 2]
And I can't be accused
Of not being there for you
How many nights have you shown up at my door?
I hope you understand
That this wasn't in my plans
But I can't be your friend anymore

[Chorus]
And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
And all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be your friend anymore

[Verse 3]
So baby now it's up to you
Do I win or do I lose
Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor
Well take me as I am
'Cause I wanna be your man
But I can't be your friend anymore

[Chorus]
And it's killing me to know you
Without having a chance to hold you
Yeah all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside
You can run to me, you can laugh at me or you can walk right out that door
But I can't be just friends anymore

It's Independence Day
I'm free
And it's a strange place to be
I'm gonna break these chains
Unleash the changes in me
I see an endless road
I feel the restless wind
I've lost the fear inside
Cause I've got no choice
But to live or die

[Chorus]
Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest
Time
When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself

[Verse 2]
In an empty room
With a suitcase on the floor
It'll be daylight soon
I'm gonna wage my private war
Who's watching over me
Must be a guardian angel
I just need time to breathe
And give my life
The best of me

[Chorus]
Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest
Time
When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself

Suddenly you're in this fight
Steppin' out and then

[Chorus]
Suddenly you're in this fight
Alone
Steppin' out into the great
Unknown
And the night's the hardest

When the doubts run through
Your mind
'Cause suddenly you find yourself
Alone
Suddenly you find yourself

[Verse 1]
I remember looking up
To look up to him
And I remember most the time
He wasn't there
I'd be waiting at the door
When he got home at night
He'd pass me by to go to pass out in his chair

[Chorus]
And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me

[Verse 2]
He stumbled in the gym
On graduation day
And I couldn't help but feel
So ashamed
And I wasn't surprised a bit
When he didn't stay
He stumbled out before they called my name

[Chorus]
And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me

[Verse 3]
The old mans still like he always was
But I love him anyway
If I've learned one thing from him
Its my kids will never have to say

[Chorus]
And I'd say
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're swaying side to side
You're footsteps make me dizzy
And no matter how I try
I keep tripping and stumbling
If you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy
You're leading me

Yeah walk a little straighter daddy

Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 2]
I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 3]
I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

[Verse 4]
I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Sept to do the best I can
I'll be damned

But baby I'm a real good man

I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am

2145,Sammy Kershaw,49,I Want My Money Back,2003,"

She was comin to town on a whirlwind tour
And my baby just had to go
So I stood in line for 16 hours for a 90-minute show
I spent 87 dollars for nosebleed tickets
And another 20 on a beer
It kinda looked like Madonna but a whole lot smaller
I couldn't really tell from there

*Chorus*
I want my money
I want my money back
I know its gone I should move on
But that don't change the fact
It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
So where's my money
I want my money back

I spent 4 long years fillin up my head with a higher education
They promised me the skills I need to improve my situation
45 grand bought a long black gown and a tassel on my hat
Now I'm qualified to super-size
And say do you want fries with that

*Chorus*
I want my money
I want my money back
I know its gone I should move on
But that don't change the fact
It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
So where's my money
I want my money back

I know I'm only dreamin, yeah
I'm never gonna see it again
But it doesn't hurt to ask

It just ain't right
No way nobody should do somebody like that
I want my money
Where's my money
Find that money cuz I need my money
Gimme my money
I want my money back
Gimme my money back
Gimme my money back
I want my money back

I've been driving and I've been thinking
For at least a hundred miles
And I'm seeing a lot of things I never saw before
For the first time leaving you doesn't feel quite so wrong
But then again I've never been this far gone

Well I was running flat on empty
Running scared for quite some time
So afraid of what I might do if I stopped ,oh yeah
But I did and I can't believe
I'm back on the highway and not on the phone

But then again I've never been this far gone

All the other times my heart turned me around
But this time I'm not going back
I'm way past that point now

You know I never really thought
I could make it on my own
But then again I've never been this far gone
Oh then again I've never been this far gone

Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate

Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

[Chorus 1]
Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
(Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Victoria's Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Walmart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV

No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
(Hell yeah!)

[Chorus 3]
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad

Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy

Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain

To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

Paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring

2151,Keith Urban,5,You'll Think Of Me,2004,"

[Verse 1]
I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

[Verse 3]
Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
Ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby

And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one
I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's ok, but

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And now I
Know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me awhile
'Cause I still love you desperately

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And now I
Watch the sun going down
There ain't nobody around
I feel a night in the breeze
I keep on telling myself
I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please, but

And now I

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And now
Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
I still love you desperately
I still love you
I still want you
I still love you desperately

2153,Kenny Chesney & Uncle Kracker,7,When The Sun Goes Down,2004,"

[Verse 1: Kenny Chesney]
Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Uncle Kracker]
All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Verse 3: Kenny Chesney & Uncle Kracker]
This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Outro]
We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

2154,Montgomery Gentry,8,If You Ever Stop Loving Me,2004,"

My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is ""bring it on""
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

Ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

Tell me what I have to do tonight
'Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again
I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said
Let's be us again

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh us again

[Verse 2]
Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
And even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in

Baby baby what would I do
I can't imagine life without you

[Chorus]
Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Oh, here I am
I'm reaching out for you
So won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh let's be us again

[Verse 1]
Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo somewhere in between
She only shows to me
Hey we're going out dancing she's ready tonight
So damn good-looking boys it ain't even right
And when bar tender says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him man

[Chorus]
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough

[Verse 2]
Baby got a '69 mustang
Four on the floor, and you ought to hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's away we go
Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care
Blue bandana tied all up in her hair
Just sitting there singing every song on the radio

[Chorus]
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs something' with a little more edge and a little more pain
She's my little whiskey Girl
My Ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like them rough

She ain't into wine and roses

2157,Brooks & Dunn,11,That's What She Gets For Loving Me,2004,"

[Verse 1]
She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things

[Chorus]
That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me
Mmm-hmm

[Verse 2]
At times, I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me

[Chorus]
That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me

[Bridge]
Whatever turns her on
I'm here to do it
'Till the day they write my name in stone
I'll live to prove it

Oh, that's what she gets

That's what she gets for loving me

Little hula girls on the shot glass
All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright

Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go
'Cause you're getting to me
In those cut off jeans
And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joes

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Yeah the deep end might be so close
Oh that I'm hangin' on for dear life
Yeah I might be a little bit loco baby
But a little bit crazy's alright
(That's right)

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok

Passenger side, I slide on in
Vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun
Chewin' on a Slim Jim, can't stop thinkin' 'bout him
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet in the passenger seat, yeah

I daydream of me an' a cold cotton pillow
And the feel of his skin
The window sill smiles and before I know it
I'm miles away a-sittin' next to him
Miles away a-sittin' next to him

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet, yeah

Shiftin' those gears, baby, 1, 2, 3
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this
Then we kiss

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, life's so sweet, it's...

So sweet in the passenger seat

2161,Reba McEntire,15,Somebody,2004,"

At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says, ""I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who you're looking for is""

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there
Oh, somewhere out there is somebody

I don't want to rush this thing
I don't want to jump the gun
I really want to say those three little words
But I'm going to bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just going to lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too

[Verse 2]
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hoping you'd go first
Don't leave me hanging out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wanting me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too

I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U

Are you feeling it too

2163,Brad Paisley Featuring Alison Krauss,17,Whiskey Lullaby,2004,"

[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Break: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on
It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again

[Chorus]
And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Sometimes I feel like I need
To shake myself
To wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin'
Through my life
It's like I'm swimmin' in
An ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly
Goin' numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard
My heart
Till I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building
Up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep
Wishin' it would fall
So I could feel the ground
Beneath me
Really taste this air I'm
Breathin'
And know that I'm alive
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
Somethin' deep inside
Keeps sayin'
Life is like a vapor
It's gone in just the
Twinklin' of an eye
I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like the sun on a
Beautiful mornin'
Sing to the Heavens like a
Church bell ringin'
Fight with the devil and go
Down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be
Alone
Take everything that this
World has to give
I want to live
I want to take every
Breath I can get
I want to live

Got beat up on his way home from school...
Again!
His dad caught him runnin out the back
Tears in his eyes and a baseball bat
Oohooh revenge!
Said ""son I won't stop you but before you go
Let me tell you a little story bout the
Toughest man i know

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek
Don't think for a minute, he was weak
Cuz in the end, he showed them
He was anything but frail...
They hammered him to a cross
But he was tougher than nails

Well he dropped that bat like it weighed a ton
Father put his arms around his son and said..
Just let it go...
Believe me I've been in your shoes
Had to ask myself ""what would Jesus do""
And here's what i know
Whenever I'm in doubt I look up what he said
It's all there in the good book
In black and white and red

They hit him and he just turned the other cheek
Don't think for a minute, he was weak
Cuz in the end, he showed them
He was anything but frail...
They hammered him to a cross
But he was tougher than nails!

Yeah in the end, he showed them

She swears I'm as tough as nails

Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
She's my world, she's my everything

Sometimes she cries on my shoulder
When she's lying next to me
But she don't know that when I hold her
That she's really holding me, holding me

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her

Yeah, and the funny thing is
She thinks she's the lucky one

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms

""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Bridge]
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

[Chorus]
So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

[Verse 3]
I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back

Her sister's sick
She's gotta baby-sit

Now you didn't hear any of this from me
But things aren't always what they seem
Brace yourself
This may come as a shock to you

Girls lie, too
We don't care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don't matter anyway
Girls lie, too
Don't think you're the only ones
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some
We learn from you
Girls lie, too

We can't wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooters for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don't wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you

Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again
Girls lie, too

Old gray sweatpants turn us on
We like your friends and we love your mom
And that's the truth
Girls lie, too
Yeah that's the truth
Girls lie, too

No, we don't care how much hair you have
Yeah, that looks good
Comb it over like that

2171,Rachel Proctor,25,Me And Emily,2004,"

Floorboard's filled with baby toys
And empty coke bottles and coffee cups
Driving through the rain with no radio
Trying not to wake her up

Cell phone says ""low battery""
God, what if I break down?
I'm just looking for an exit with a lotta lights
A safe little interstate town

Just a cheap hotel
With a single bed
And cable TV
Is good enough for me and Emily

Someday when she's old enough
She's gonna start asking questions about him
Some kid at school brings his Dad for show and tell
And gets her little mind a-wondering
""Where's my Daddy?
Do I have one?
Does he not love me like you do?""

Oh, maybe I'll find someone
To love the both of us
And I'll tell her
When she's old enough to know the truth

Will it break her heart?
Will she understand
That I had to leave?
That's what was best for me and Emily

That house was never clean enough
His dinner never warm enough
Nothing I did was ever good enough to make him happy
So I guess he gave me what he thought I deserved
But it would kill me if he ever raised his hand to her

Big rigs are throwing rain on my windshield
And I feel like they're laughing at me
Finally the storm is lettin' up
And the morning is breaking free

It's a brand new day
It's a second chance
Yesterday is just a memory
For me and Emily

Floorboard is filled with baby toys
And empty coke bottles and coffee cups
Least there's one good thing that he gave me
And she's starting to wake up

2172,Martina McBride,26,How Far,2004,"

[Verse 1]
There's a boat, I could sail away
There's the sky, I could catch a plane
There's a train, there's the tracks
I could leave and I could choose to not come back
Oh never come back
There you are, giving up the fight
Here I am begging you to try
Talk to me, let me in
But you just put your wall back up again
Oh when's it going to  end

[Chorus]
How far do I have to go to make you understand
I want to  make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't
Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are
So I'm going to walk away
And it's up to you to say how far

[Verse 2]
There's a chance I could change my mind
But I won't, not till you decide
What you want, what you need
Do you even care if I stay or leave
Oh, what's it going  be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Out of this chair, or just across the room
Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon

[Chorus]

[Outro]
YeahI'm gonna walk away
And it's up to you to say how far

You got a great apartment
And a real nice car
The job you've always wanted
You're gonna go far
You got everything you need in this world
But you got the wrong girl

Everybody's looking cause she looks so hot
You don't know it yet but
I know what you've got
Go ahead and give it a whirl
But you got the wrong girl

If you're looking for love
You're looking too hard
You can't see that what you need
Is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds
And you've missed a pearl
Yeah, you got the wrong girl

Does she like fishing
Four-wheeling in the woods
Will she get her hands greasy
Up underneath the hood
I bet she never listens to Merle
Yeah, you got the wrong girl

If you're looking for love
You're looking too hard
You can't see that what you need
Is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds
And you've missed a pearl
You got the wrong girl

Yeah you got the wrong girl
Yeah you got the wrong girl
You got the wrong girl
Yeah you got the wrong girl

How long has it been
How long have you held it in
And how long will you wait
Before you let somebody take your breath away, again

I wanna be the one who turns you on
Makes love till the lonely's gone
Be the man you have dreamed of all your life
I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

Tell me what to do
And I'll do what you want me too
Cause darlin I believe
That I have fallen hopelessly and helplessly for you

I wanna be the one who turns you on
Makes love till the lonely's gone
Be the man you have dreamed of all your life
I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

I swear I'll make it last untill tears of joy come pourin from your eyes
I wanna make you cry

2175,Joe Nichols,29,If Nobody Believed In You,2004,"

I watched him take the two strike call
He hadn't tried to swing at all
I guess he had all he could take
He walked away for goodness sake
His father's voice was loud and mean
""You won't amount to anything""

That little boy quit trying
He just walked away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

That old man said, ""One more try
I know I'm not too old to drive
I promise son, I'll do my best
This time I'm gonna pass the test""
""Give me the keys dad and get in""
His father never drove again

That old man quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

We take his name out of schools
The lawyers say it breaks the rules
Pledge of allegiance can not be read
And under God should not be said
I wonder how much he will take
I just pray it's not too late

What if God quit trying
He just turned away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you

Tell me how would you feel
You'd probably give up too
If nobody believed in you...

Spent the night with Jim Beam and Johnny Walker Red
Woke up with a freight train runnin through my head
I'm a beer man

Bobby's more the wine kind
Donny does his shots
Sammy sips Martini's
Willie smokes pot
But I'm a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple maybe, but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Take your Caviar and that fish--it ain't cooked
Take it off the cracker and throw it on a hook
I'm a beer man
Lord and if I was a rich man, tell ya what I'd do
I'd be the same ol' plain ol' guy you always knew
Just a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Yeah I've done a lil steppin out there on a limb
My open mind winds up closed again

He was a bad boy
And i was a good girl
He needed me to smooth out the edges
Well he'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
And after two years of his crap i quit beggin'
Im a magnet for the fixer upper man
If i know that it's fire do i let it burn my hand?

Cupid works for the devil be suspicious if he cries
You know sex is usually good yeah but it ain't always right
Chocolate is a bandaid no matter what they say
Shoes don't stretch, and men don't change

My friend lisa, she loves a liar
She found out about his other girlfriends
He makes excuses so she forgives him
And she swears she's gonna leave if he screws up again
But he's good lookin that's why she don't see
He's got her exactly where he wants her to be

Sex is usually good
Shoes dont stretch

Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low

I'd play sally goodin all day if I could
But the lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I could, work when I should

Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean

And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
Said, live a good life and play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy

My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 1]
Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pouring down
There's something smoking underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town
Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

[Verse 2]
Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
Baby, leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Oh, no...

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down
It's too late to turn around
I'd sure hate to break down here

2183,The Jenkins,37,Blame It On Mama,2004,"

When i was six or seven mama tucked me in
With a lalaby that made my eyes open wide again
I'd lie awake and wonder why a boy named Billy Joe
Jumped off the Talahatche bridge to the river far below

Blame it on mama and the songs she loved to sing
I'm not from Lousiana but that dont mean a thing
Don't come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee
Just blame it on mama she sang the country into me

I just loved to listen as she sang those story songs
Bout a coat of many colors or a girl named Delta Dawn
When the lights went out in goegia i would beg for just one more
All about fancy and pretty red satin dancin dress she wore

Blame it on mama and the songs she loved to sing
I'm not from Lousiana but that dont mean a thing
Dont come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee
Just blame it on mama she sang the country into me

I'm a coal miners daughter lovin that preachers son
I could walk the streets of Laredo stare down the barrel of a lawmans gun
I've grown roots and i've got ties to places i've never been
And when i sing those songs it takes me right back home again

Blame it on mama and the songs she loved to sing
I'm not from Lousiana but that dont mean a thing
Dont come from Alabama or hail from Tennessee
Just blame it on mama she sang the country into me

The country in to me, yeah

There's crime in the city streets
Always trouble in the middle east
How'd they let things get so out of hand?
Just watching the evening news
That would give anybody the blues
The more I know, I think the less I understand

Oh, why can't we all just get a long neck
And make a toast to peace and harmony?
Why, why can't we all just get a long neck
And see how good getting along might be?

I'd like buy the world a round
In a honky tonk on neutral ground
Where we can see, inside we're all the same
Pop a top and let the good times pour
Til we forget what we was fighting for
I'll ask again, can someone please explain?

As different as we may be
We're all one big family
If we just agree
We're going to disagree

[Verse 1]
Tommy's daddy, kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough
To do what Daddy's did
It didn't take us long to go
From drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house
I stumbled just a bit

[Chorus]
You play it cool
But it's no use
Dad aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover
Up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

[Verse 2]
We lost Daddy
In nineteen ninety-nine
I took care of everybody's pain
Except for mine
And then one night
My wife took my face in her hands
She said, ""I think it's time you cry
For your old man""

[Chorus]
You play it cool
But it's no use
She aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
And my teardrops finally fell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

[Verse 3]
I could probably do more
To help my fellow man
But life gets busy
And I hope God understands
Someday, when I get time
I'll do more than my share
Funny how I'm thinking this
Sitting in my easy chair

[Chorus]
You play it cool
But it's no use
God aren’t no fool
And that's the truth
And he won't let you fool yourself
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

2186,Chely Wright,40,Back Of The Bottom Drawer,2004,"

(Written by Chely Wright and Julian ""Jay"" Alphonso Williams

In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept
But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces of my past
That I shouldn't have to share

A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry
In a ""Dear Jane"" letter from a different guy
He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right
And a stolen key from an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer

I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at
I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't want to mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff

A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it ""I love you"" so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98
We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars, closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer

I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays

So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way
Or no way at all
And now I cherish love a whole lot more
'Cause of what's
In the back of the bottom drawer

With a letterman's jacket and a chevrolet
Thought I was cool
Yea, I ruled the school

Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright

With a little bita live, little bita learn
Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight
Littel bita kiss and makin' up all night and
One day waking up
Oh in a real love

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
""Guess what? Yea baby ready or not""

I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?

They say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
""Sorry, but I got to go""
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

[Chorus 1]
Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a-racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morning
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl to just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

[Chorus 2]
Now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
Going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yee-hoo!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 3]
She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

It hits me so deep inside

It's a sweet, sweet rush
I'm in love with your kiss
You're the one that I trust the most
You changed me

2190,Josh Turner,44,What It Ain't,2004,"

[Verse]
I have been around
This old block before
I've walked into abruptly closing doors
Schooled in hard knocks, I've learned a lot
About how a heart can brake
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain' t
It ain't laying in the dark and wondering why she hasn't called
And now it's 2 am
It ain't driving by her house to find her wrapped up in the arms of you ex-best friend
It ain't bold face lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain' t
You say you could
Show me how to love
Baby there's one thing
You can be sure of
I wouldn't treat you wrong cause I've been on
The hurting side of pain
I might not know what love is but I know what it ain `t
It ain't showing up for dinner with a rose and chardonnay
Then drinking by yourself
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii saying we can still be friends
But I met someone else
It ain't bold face lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain't
It ain't a mink coat, forty pairs of shoes, two 14 karat anklets on my master card
It ain't walking in a pawn shop, recognizing her engagement ring she swore she lost
It ain't bold face lies or alibis that cannot be explained
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain' t
If you had all day I could tell you things
That would make a grown man faint
I might not know what love is
But I know what it ain' t
Yeah I know what it ain' t

Found an old box in the bottom of the closet
'Neath a bowling ball bag full of magazines
Had a school sweater with a ring in the pocket
From my first cigar - man did I turn green
Hey honey come look at what I just found
This old picture of us when the carnival came to town

I was superman, tarzan
Thought I was a star in a rock n roll band
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
I wasn't very good
But you were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
Now Baby look at us

There's a bracelet I made you at your homecoming party
Bought a six-pack of Bud just to get tabs
Took you home and you wore it proudly
But i got in big trouble when you showed your dad
Here's a speaker from the Dickson Drive-In show
What movie was playing we never did know

I was Superman, Tarzan
Thought I was a star in a rock n roll band
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
I wasn't very good
But you were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
And baby look at us

You were the biggest fan of the man
That your momma warned you not to trust
And baby look at us

I was Superman, Tarzan
You were Lois Lane, Lady Jane
Yeah and baby look at us
Look at us...

2192,Brad Cotter,46,I Meant To,2004,"

Things get in the way, rush of every day
Ordinary stuff we all get into
Wouldn't it be sad, if all you ever had
Was a granite epitaph that said I meant to?

So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, I meant to
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
And make 'em tell the naked truth, I meant to

I'm always on the run, things get lost
Some things get done
But if I didn't have all the fun, I meant to
I meant to

If I never came out and said
To each and every woman I love
How much I really do
I meant to

Maybe this one chance is all we really have
Maybe all you got is what you get to
Well I ain't gonna cry, I'll give it my best try
And kiss the world goodbye and say I meant to

So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss
Any crazy thing I didn't do, I meant to
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye
And make 'em tell the naked truth, I meant to

I'm always on the run, things get lost
Some things get done
But if I didn't have all the fun, I meant to
I meant to

And if I never came out and said
To each and every woman I love
How much I really do
I meant to

I meant to
I meant to

2193,Rodney Atkins,47,Someone To Share It With,2004,"

[Verse 1]
I've got dreams and aspirations
And I'm pretty good at conversations
I've got a heart I want to give
But I need someone to share it with
I love music and don't mind dancing
I'm easygoing, a little bit old-fashioned
I'm a sucker for sunsets, but the trouble is
I need someone to share it with

[Chorus]
We're living all alone together
Like we don't even know each other anymore
I miss my friend, I miss my lover
We can rediscover everything that made us fall in love before

[Verse 2]
If you've got time you don't mind spending
I've got a world that feels like it's ending
Cause Baby, you're my life, but I can't live like this
I need someone to share it with

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I miss my friend, I miss my lover
We can rediscover everything
That made us fall in love before
Because I've got dreams and aspirations
And I'm pretty good at conversations
And I've got a heart I want to give
I just need someone to share it with

2195,Rushlow,49,Sweet Summer Rain,2004,"

Three or four miles down a red dirt road
Lived a green-eyed girl, I used to go to see her
I'd pull up the drive and she'd jump in
And we'd head off down around the bend to the river

Find a perfect spot and throw a blanket on the ground
Sit there talkin' till the sun went down, about nothing
Then one hot day in June, the clouds rolled in right out of the blue
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume and that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

We were jumpin' and runnin' and laughin' out loud
The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah
We dove in the car, turned the radio on
Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie and the Jets

She turned and looked my way
Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face
I reached out and kissed her
Well, I remember that taste of that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Sweet summer rain
It keeps blowin' through my mind
Even after all this time
I can't forget that moment, yeah we were falling just like that

Sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Yeah, that sweet
(I still remember)
Sweet summer rain
(Sweet rain fallin' down on us)

Oh that sweet

Yeah, that sweet

It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up
Since you did me wrong

[Chorus]
Well how am I doing since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you done to me

[Verse 1]
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy

Under your thumb and

Getting right every night
With every single ever-loving girl in sight, so

Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they

I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard

In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

Yes, I am

I'm sure you waited for a long, long time
To find a man like mine
But honey

There's two ways we can do this
I'll let you decide
You can take it somewhere else
Or we can take it outside, you little

Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen

Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted

I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Well, ask anybody I'm a pretty good guy
And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothin in my past that I'm tryin hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Cruise all around the right parking lots
Little time gets killed alotta bull gets shot
One who'll think I'm kinda cute and laugh at every joke I got
When I get to thinkin maybe she's athinkin maybe not

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Had an old man tell me ""Boy if you were smart
You'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart""
So I bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
But all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you

[Chorus 1]
I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 2]
And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Chorus 2]
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 3]
Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two

[Chorus 1]
But I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Chorus 2]
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

5,Trace Adkins,6,Songs About Me,2005,"

[Verse 1]
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

[Chorus]
'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Verse 2]
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those

[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole

Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is

Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out

[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

8,George Strait,9,You'll Be There,2005,"

Hope is an anchor and love is a ship
Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going till you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars well, you'd better have a map
A compass and a conscience so you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonely island where no one wants to be

From the beginning of creation I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us to the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world where we have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all, we'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing

Oh, my, my

I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there

Oh, my, my

You don't bring nothin' with you here and you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin', scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high till I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me, would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand to see you both someday

Oh, my, my

So I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there

Oh, my, my

9,Andy Griggs,10,If Heaven,2005,"

If heaven was an hour, it would be twilight
When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn
And supper's on the stove and mamma's laughin'
And everybody's workin' day is done

If heaven was a town it would be my town
Oh, on a summer day in 1985
And everything I wanted was out there waitin'
And everyone I loved was still alive

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
So cool and sweet and heavy on your tongue
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
And there'd always be enough for everyone

If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
That could take this weary trav'ler 'round the bend
And if heaven was a tear it'd be my last one
And you'd be in my arms again

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

Yeah, if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Verse 2]
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

[Chorus]
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland

I don't stop breathing everytime the phone rings
My heart don't race when someone's at my door
I've almost given up thinking you're ever gonna call
I don't believe in magic anymore
I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God to get you off my mind
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This ol' job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
But at least I don't have whiskey on my breath
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

God I hope you're happy
Girl I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell

I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If I ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night, I couldn't say a word
I stood there in the dark all by myself
Yeah, I could have said a million things
But all I did was keep it locked inside
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

It's gettin' better all the time

Never gonna make it there by 9:00

There's got to be something more
Got to be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss

Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for

Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why?
I got things to do before I die

14,Sugarland,15,Baby Girl,2005,"

[Verse 1]
They say this town
The stars stay up all night
Don't know can't see them
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well it's 2,000 miles and one left turn

[Chorus]
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
(I'm playing here at the bar tonight)
This time I'm going to make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

[Verse 2]
Black top blue sky
Big town full of little white lies
Everybody's your friend you can never be sure
They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings
All sorts of shiny things
Girl, you'll remember what your knees are for

[Chorus]
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
(I'm playing here at the bar tonight)
This time I'm going to make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

[Outro]
I know that I'm on my way
When I can tell every time I play
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say

[Chorus]
Dear Mom and Dad
I'll send money
I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well it ought to be more then enough to get you through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
I'm stayin here at the Ritz tonight
What do you know we made our dreams come true!
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
Well they all add up to nothing compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

[Outro]
Your baby girl
Your baby girl
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry because I'm alright
I'm playin here at the bar tonight
Dreams come true

15,Darryl Worley,16,If Something Should Happen,2005,"

Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back

If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen
Mm hmm hmm

"
16,Kenny Chesney,17,Keg In The Closet,2005,"

[Verse 1]
We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Verse 2]
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Bridge]
We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

17,Jeff Bates,18,Long  Slow Kisses,2005,"

[Verse 1: Jeff Bates, spoken]
Hey baby, I guess you're wondering
What I'm doing home so soon; no I ain't sick
It's just this morning when you told me
You didn't feel like you were the most important thing in my life

[Verse 2: Jeff Bates, spoken]
And you know what
That well broke my heart
So I had to turn around and come back
And tell you what I'm gonna do about it

[Chorus: Jeff Bates]
I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses

[Verse 3: Jeff Bates, spoken]
I just wanna let you know how ashamed I am
For making you feel that way darling, I'm so sorry
I guess I've just been spending too much time on making a living
And way too little on making love

[Verse 4: Jeff Bates, spoken]
But if you can find it in your heart
To forgive me girl
I swear from this moment on
You'll always know where you stand with me

[Chorus: Jeff Bates]
I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We'll lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
I'm gonna resurrect the love
That slipped away from us
And the man you've been missing
Starting with some long, slow kisses

[Verse 5: Jeff Bates]
'Cause what really matters most
Is you and me this close
Feeling no distance
Sharing some long, slow kisses
Sharing some long, slow kisses

18,Tim McGraw,19,Drugs Or Jesus,2005,"

[Verse 1]
In my home town
For anyone who sticks around
You are either lost or you are found
There is not much in between
In my home town
Everything is still black and white
It is a long, long way from wrong to right
From Sunday morning to Saturday night

[Chorus]
Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

[Verse 2]
My whole life
I have tried to run, I have tried to hide
From the stained glass windows in my mind
Refusing to let God's light shine
Down on me
Down on me

[Chorus]
Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

[Bridge]
Everybody wants acceptance
We all just want some proof
Everyone is just looking for the truth

[Chorus]
Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We are all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

"
19,Blake Shelton,20,Goodbye Time,2005,"

[Verse 1]
It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

[Verse 2]
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

[Outro]
Goodbye, Baby

20,Bobby Pinson,21,Don't Ask Me How I Know,2005,"

Don't ride your bike off a ramp that's more than three bricks high
Don't take that candy from the store if you ain't got the dime
Don't pick a fight with a little guy that doesn't talk that much
Don't pick up a cherrybomb thinkin' it's a dud
And don't sneak out of a 2 story house usin' bed sheets for a rope
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus:)
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', save the Jesus off the dash
Say a prayer when you feel like cussin', save your money pay with cash
Forget your pride, buy the roses, if you're sorry tell her so
Don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know

Don't quit your high school football team halfway through the season
Don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it
Don't lose a girl you love at home for a night in Panama City
Don't rush off the phone when your Mama calls you ain't that busy
Ya oughta make that drive to say goodbye to your grampa â€˜fore he goes
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus)
Forget your pride buy the roses, if you love her tell her so
Don't go to Vegas with your heart broke
Don't bum your cousin for that first smoke
I'm tellin' ya, don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
I just know
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', say a prayer when you feel like cussin'
I know

Hey baby whatcha doin' this evening?
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado
And I iced down a six-pack, uh-oh

Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth

[Chorus:]
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees

[Chorus]
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers

Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me?

[Chorus]
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers

Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go, pickin' wildflowers?
Pickin' wildflowers?

23,Toby Keith,24,As Good As I Once Was,2005,"

[Verse 1]
She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

"
24,Alan Jackson,25,The Talkin' Song Repair Blues,2005,"

The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, ""This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all.""

""The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck""
He said, ""I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, ""Ain't you that songwriter guy?""
I said, ""Yes, I am,"" he said, ""So am I.""

And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, ""What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back.""

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, ""This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, ""Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news

But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you.""

And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long
You guessed it
It may be a hit
I like it...

25,Lonestar,26,Class Reunion (That Used To Be Us),2005,"

[Verse 1]
Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recognize anyone there

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us

[Verse 2]
I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us

[Bridge]
As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder
Who will we be ten years from now

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh that used to be us
That used to be us
That used to be us

[Intro]
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

[Verse 1]
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Verse 2]
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways

27,SHeDAISY,28,Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing,2005,"

Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
And had it fall on your head
Well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles
Your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
Really gotta go - Oh no!

(Chorus)
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Ever sat yourself down when the
Seat is all wet
Or see your ""ex"" sucking face with
A little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
Best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
Bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!

(Repeat Chorus)
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)

Don't worry, don't worry

(Bridge:)
We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)

Don't worry, don't worry

Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

28,Reba McEntire,29,My Sister,2005,"

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, it's me, I just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way, I miss you too

[Chorus 1]
I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties, dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We'd make up and laugh all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister, my friend

[Verses 2]
Oh yeah, before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family

[Chorus 2]
Seems like just yesterday
You brought home - oh, what's his name?
He had been drinking
What were you thinking?
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
'Cause we've learned a lot since then
My sister, my friend

[Bridge]
Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon?
We could just hang out like we used to

[Chorus 3]
It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister, my friend

29,Pat Green,30,Baby Doll,2005,"

She stops and checks her reflection in a car parked on the corner
She says its hell on me this working down at the diner
Some people say man she was hot back when she was younger
Yeah well she was a dancer when she lived in LA

Well she was someone's baby doll
A beauty queen to someone long ago
For the midnight show

And if you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll

She stops and checks her reflection in the bathroom on her lunch break
She says ""I still look good for someone half of my real age""
Some people say ""Man I bet she still makes love like an earthquake""
Yeah but man she ain't easy ... she ain't letting you in my friend, my friend

Its time to wake up baby doll
Put your best dress and your high heals on
And dream your gone

When you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll

She stops and calls an old friend from the payphone at the subway
She says I feel like I'm just sitting here wasting my days away
It's time to move on baby doll
And walk away just like you did before ... when you wanted more

When you close your eyes
You hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
When she was a younger girl ... a pretty heart in a tainted world
Not sure who you wanna be
Your daddy's little drama queen
I hope that when you find yourself
You're more than just a baby doll

"
30,Van Zant,31,Help Somebody,2005,"

Written by Kip Raines and Jeffrey Steele

Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man
He came from the school where you didn't need nothin'
If you couldn't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
""No Sir,"" ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""By God,"" ""Be darned,""
""Hell yeah, I'm American.""
In all the years he walked this earth
I swear all he did was work
He said: ""The devil dreams on an idle horse
""So you listen to me squirt

""Don't get too high on the bottle
And get right with the Man
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can. ""

Now Granny said: ""Sonny, stick to your ganas
If you believe in something, no matter what
'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than be loved for who you're not. ""
She was five feet of concrete
New York born an' raised on a slick city street
She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground
Still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:
Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:

""Don't get too high on the bottle
Just a little sip ev'ry now and then
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""

Instrumental Break
(C'mon now.)

""I never let a cowboy make the coffee.""
Yeah, that's what Granny always said to my Grandad
And he'd say: ""Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once.""
And ""if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans.""

""Don't get too high on the bottle
Get right with the Man, son
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""

Yeah
(Get too high.)
(Help somebody if you can.)

I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size
I been known to cause a few break ups
I been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work

[Chorus 1]
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol
Alcohol

[Verse 2]
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemmingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

[Chorus 2]
Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance
I'm medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

32,Trick Pony,33,It's A Heartache,2005,"

It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothin' but a fool's game:
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
Ah, nah, nah!

Oh, it ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Ooh

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothin' but a heartache:
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

(Oh, it's a heartache,)
Oh, it's a fool's game
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Standing in the cold rain
(Standing in the cold rain.)
Feelin' like a clown

(It's a heartache,)
It's a heartache
(Nothin' but a heartache:)
Love him till your arms break
(Love him till your arms break.)
Ah, then he lets you down
Oh, yeah, down

33,Toby Keith,34,Honkytonk U,2005,"

[Verse 1]
My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a greyhound, and I went
To stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
A hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't
Last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbing' drilling' rig, I'm oil field trash and
Proud as I can be
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
I am a red, white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U

[Verse 2]
A star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't
Ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and
Play it loud
As long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out ever basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
Son I'm a red, white, and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U
That's right a red, white, and blue
Blood graduate of honkytonk U

34,Trisha Yearwood,35,Georgia Rain,2005,"

Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
The ol' dirt road's paved over now
Nothin' here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain

35,Buddy Jewell,36,If She Were Any Other Woman,2005,"

[Verse 1:]
If she were any other woman
I wouldn't be going home right now
I'd stay out a little while longer
Put another coat of paint on this town

If she were any other woman
I'd go home just to keep the peace
But I've found she's where I find it
So that's where I want to be

[Chorus:]
If she were any other woman
She wouldn't have this hold on me
Ain't no woman like my woman
So there ain't no other man
I'd rather be

[Verse 2:]
If she were any other woman
Lord knows she might of thought twice
About hanging all her dreams on a dreamer
Cause it ain't been any easy ride

If she were any other woman
No telling where I'd be right now
She keeps my head from turning
And my feet on solid ground

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
She wouldn't stay on my mind
Morning noon and night
She wouldn't move me like she does

[Repeat Chorus:]

Ain't no woman like my woman
So there ain't no other man
I'd rather be

"
36,Jamie O'Neal,37,Somebody's Hero,2005,"

She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park
To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game

She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl
(But)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs

The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition

But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest

It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home

She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

37,LeAnn Rimes,38,Probably Wouldn't Be This Way,2005,"

[Verse 1]
Got a date a week from Friday
With the preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson
When the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

[Chorus]
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

[Verse 2]
Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

[Chorus]
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
Probably wouldn't be this way

[Verse 1:]
I'm gonna do it darlin'
I could waste time tryin' to figure it out
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow
I've never been this far
Didn't know love could run so deep
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep

[Chorus:]
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, runnin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means
Baby, givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start

[Verse 2:]
Somethin' is goin' on
I can't explain but sure can touch
It's callin' both of us
Stronger than any fear or doubt
It's changin' everything I see
It's changin' you, it's changin' me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Right here, right now's the perfect spot, the perfect time
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine

Yeah, yeah
Holdin' you close, (Holdin' you close.)
Chasin' that moon. (Chasin' that moon.)

Shootin' out lights, (Shootin' down lights.)

39,Hanna-McEuen,40,Something Like A Broken Heart,2005,"

Tried a thousand times, used a million lines
Tryin' to explain
'Cause they don't have a word
For the kind of hurt that never goes away

When I try to think it though, it all comes back to you
I don't know why goodbye's so hard to understand
This pain I have is real an' I'll tell you how it feels
If I ever get the chance

It's like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart

I could drive a hundred miles an' never touch that dial
Till the station fades
'Cause nothin' that I hear
Will ever make it clear words just slip away

And the more I think it through, the more I think of you
I don't know why goodbye's so hard to understand
You're never hard to find, 'cause you're always on my mind
No matter where I am

Just like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart

It's like a lonely Friday night downtown
Where everyone I know is out
The radio's my only friend around
And all I do is think of you

It's a little like an old sad song
It kills you but you sing alone
The melody just tears you all apart
It's something like a broken heart

Baby, the clock on the wall is lying
It's not really that late
It's too cold outside to be walking around the streets of this town
And wherever you think you have to be can wait

(Chorus)
Why don't you stay with me?
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me, yeah

Baby, there's just no use in hiding
The way that I'm feeling right now
With you standing there, baby I swear, I can't help but stare
Girl, you're wearing me out, wearing me out

Baby, stay with me
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me

Baby, don't go
It looks like it's starting to rain
And it's so warm here in this apartment wrapped up in this blanket, so
Stay

Stay with me
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And we'll be alright as long as you stay

41,Aaron Lines,42,Waitin' On The Wonderful,2005,"

It's way too easy to live this life with your eyes half closed and don't I know
I spend half my time bored out of my mind sleepwalking
Well I wake up to this fools parade and I watch the leaves fall down
I see everything changin' but somehow i feel caged in, just hanging around

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to set me free
Out of the ordinary come and rescue me, ya I could use a little love
Love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin on the wonderful

It's that feeling that's hard to explain
When the world's so big and your so small
And you get caught up in the wonder of it all that's what I miss
I saw that look today on a young kids face
Eating icecream at the laudrymat well if you'd asked
Him it was christmas again I want to get that back

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to believe,out of the ordinary
Taste of something sweet,ya I could use a little
Love love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical I'm waitin on the wonderful

Ya,ya i'm waitin the the wonderful.I know its out there

I'm waiton on the wonderful a little something to believe
Out of the ordinary come and rescue me I could use a little love
Love love to send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical waitin on the wonderful something mystical
Waitin on the wonderful i'm waitin on the wonderful something to set me free

And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

Tractors parked out in the yard
I say you and me take it down to the barn
Pull it inside and climb to the top
Spread out a blanket in a favorite spot
Pitch that pitchfork out the way
Hillbillies love it in the hay!

Grab that bottle of strawberry wine
Plate full of chicken and some of that pie
We could be there all night long
You know how we get when we get it on
Up in the loft down yonder way (what do ya say?)
Hillbillies love it in the hay!

Lay me down on a bed of gold
Roll me 'round 'til the cows come home
Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass
Hillbillies like it like that

Sun's coming up and the rooster crows
Hound dog chewing on a chicken bone (a chicken bone)
You and me just having a ball
That's a good thing that old mule can't talk (goodness)
Ain't no telling what he might say

And as I'm putting out the flame
Somebody brings up you name

I want to be right where you are
Baby baby baby bring me down
You can look me in the eye and break my heart
Break my heart

Laughs out loud at my trusting heart

Maybe I could move on

Alone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head
Painting a picture of you
And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
Just the road and its majesty
And I'm looking at you with the world in the rear view

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you ain't got no one
To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen with your nightgown
Riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I'm singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
And im looking for you in the silence that we share

Chorus
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

47,Travis Tritt,48,I See Me,2005,"

How he got that GI Joe in the church this morning
I don't know but he ain't listening to the preacher
Like his mama taught him to
She's wanting me to cross the aisle
Go, sit over there with him awhile
Make him turn around and sit up straight
Stop playing in the pew
To watch him is all that I can do

Cause I look at him and I see a boy
And I see trouble and I see joy
See innocence and headstrong
And a heart full of dreams

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Yeah I look at him and I see me

Already says when he grows up
He's gonna have a big ole truck
And I can see him getting stuck
On some private property

He'll take chances, he'll take dare's
And keep his mama and me scared to death
When he goes out at night
You know I'll bet we'll never sleep
I guess I get what my dad got from me

Cause' I look at him and I see a teen
Having fun doing stupid things
I see roadblocks I see mistakes
I see heartbreak he can't see

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Ohhh I look at him and I see me

I look at him and I see me
Breaking down one day
As he packs up all his things
To move awayyyyy

I look at him and I'm so amazed
I'm so proud and then sooo afraid
That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree
Yeah I look at him and I see me

I don't need to wonder where he is
But I do
He oughta know that by now

I know his job takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around
He oughta know that by now

He used to promise soon things would change
It's been years and it's still the same
And that hurts
He oughta know that by now

I've grown so used to being alone
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone
And in a way I am
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what is never around
He oughta know that by now

Heart ache and coffee at midnight motels
Leaving him was hard as hell
But I did
And he oughta know that by now

I didn't try to explain
No goodbye underneath my ring
That was all I left
He oughta know that by now
That was all I left
And he oughta know that by now

Awww Yah!
Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!

She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!

Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles ... on

It's 3 AM and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why

[Chorus]
Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say ""I love you""?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?

[Verse 2]
I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?

Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say ""I love you""?

51,Dierks Bentley,2,Settle For A Slowdown,2006,"

[Verse 1]
I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

[Chorus 1]
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

[Verse 2]
I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

[Chorus 1]

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around

I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down

[Verse 1]
Jenny's got a job
A cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year
Thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
But it still ain't here
(Hey!)
She's been lookin' for Mr. Right so long
But all she's found is Mr. Wrong
That's the pits

[Pre-Chorus]
She's drawn a line that she won't cross
Her and time are facing off
She says something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give

[Verse 2]
Friday night she had a date
Cell phone junky
A half hour late
That's the biz, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
She's riding out the twists of fate
She's had all that she can take
She says something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give me butterflies
Something's gotta make me feel alive
Something's gotta give me dreams at night
Something's gotta make me feel alright
I don't know where it is
But something's gotta give

[Bridge]
I swear
There's got to be a meant to be for me out there
Somewhere someday
I'm gonna find someone, somehow, someway
Jenny's got a job
A cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year

She thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
She says something's got
Something's got
Something's gotta

53,Jack Ingram,4,Wherever You Are,2006,"

This desert wind is burnin' my face again
God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

(Chorus)
Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me

Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

[Verse 2]
Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue

55,Faith Hill,6,The Lucky One,2006,"

[Verse 1]
So hot outside, all I can wear Is these cut off overalls
The sandals on my feet
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket
So I could sit there on a broken seat
I got no place I should go, I got no worries you know
Second or seventh street, it doesn't matter to me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

[Verse 2]
Well, I pulled back down to my up street apartment
And the air never works in that old place
Twenty-seven and I thought I'd be further along
Than just this rented space
I got no papers to read, I got no cable TV
And I got no places to be, I got no people to meet

[Chorus]
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night, yeah
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
Yeah, I'm a lucky one

I'm on a roll
When I'm with you
Don't stop me now
I just can't lose

'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night
'Cause you're mine
That's all I need to know
The sunshine's everywhere we go
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold
Every night
Yeah, I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one
Yeah, I'm the lucky one
I'm the lucky one

56,Phil Vassar,7,Last Day Of My Life,2006,"

I just left Bobby's house:
The service was today
Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is
As I drove away
You know Amy was his only love
In a moment she was gone, long gone:
It could have been me or you
Oh, baby, there's no time to lose

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life

I drive off when the sun comes up:
I get back when it's gone down
There's so much I wanna do with you
But I can't be around
Whoa, time has been just like a thief
It's stolen too much from us
So once it's gone we can't make it up
So tonight, let's get back in touch

I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my...

Life is a rainbow, it's a spring snow
It's the mornin' dew
An' I don't wanna waste another minute
Without you

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life
I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life
Oh, oh

Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo

58,Rascal Flatts,9,What Hurts The Most,2006,"

[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Outro]
Not seeing that love in you
That’s what I was trying to do

"
59,Bon Jovi Duet With Jennifer Nettles,10,Who Says You Can't Go Home,2006,"

I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

Someday she wants a big ol' house
Sittin' on a big ol' hill
And a mile long tree lined driveway
For her big ol' Coupe DeVille
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' bank account
With too much to spend
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

Someday she wants a big o' ring
With a big ol' rock that shines
And a big ol' walk-in closet
With shoes of every kind
Yeah, someday she wants a big ol' boat
She can lay around gettin' a tan
But right now all she wants is a man

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

With a big ol' heart
Who can love her like nobody can
Big ol' kisses that go on and on
And never end
With a big ol' smile
He'll fill her world with laughter
Size matters, size matters

[Verse 1]
A gun goes off in a far off city
A siren wails right here at home
Well sometimes life ain't all that pretty
When you're watching it all alone

[Verse 2]
You build a wall around your feelings
Just another heart afraid to break
And you don't wanna let me in cause really
What difference can I make?

[Chorus]
I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours

[Verse 3]
So let Jesus look down on this mess
And let the powers that be just fuss and fight
Cause everyone needs to pick their battles and
We all realize

[Chorus]
That I can't change the world
Baby, that's for sure
But if you let me, girl
I can change yours
I bet I can change yours

[Verse 4]
And every time you light a flame
You just get burned and you feel like
It's all in vain
You feel like
You need to learn that no one's gonna save you
No, no one's gonna save you
But I'm standing here
My heart's on my sleeve
Never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna leave you

[Outro]
Baby, that's for sure
Oh I can't change the world
But I can change yours
I bet I can change
Yours

62,Keith Anderson,13,Every Time I Hear Your Name,2006,"

[Verse 1]
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Verse 2]
Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you

[Chorus]
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me""
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Bridge]
So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Outro]
Every time I hear your name
(Every time I hear your name)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah ah, every time I hear your name

63,George Strait,14,The Seashores Of Old Mexico,2006,"

[Verse 1]
I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

[Outro]
Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know, ha, ha
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 1]
18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
""Baby, don't forget""

[Verse 2]
Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

[Interlude]
Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

[Verse 3]
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
""Hey mama, don't forget

[Chorus 2]
To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me""

[Verse 4]
Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But ""Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah, I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me""

I've had big dreams come true and I believe in
Angels although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind cause baby I got you

The rain keeps the flowers from dyin'
The sun lights the world when its shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth livin'
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayers I've been answered
I did something right cause
Baby I got you

The rain keeps the flowers from dyin'
The sun lights the world when its shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I am letting go while I am still strong enough to
It is got a little too sad
I am a little too blue
It is a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I am big time over your baby
It is a little too late

No I do not want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door

There was a time
This heart of mine
Would take you back every time
Do not you know?
It is been two packs of cigarettes
A sleepless night
A nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you have got no business coming around
I am closing up shop
Shutting us down

It is a little too late
I am a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on

68,Gary Allan,19,Life Ain't Always Beautiful,2006,"

Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful ride

Well you know those times
When you feel like there's a sign there on your back
Say's I don't mind if ya kick me
Seems like everybody has
Things go from bad to worse
You'd think they can't get worse than that
And then they do

You still walk the straight and narrow
And you don't know where you are
Use the needle of your compass
To sew up your broken heart
Ask directions from a genie
In a bottle of Jim Beam
And she lies to You
That's when you learn the truth

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Well I been deep down in that darkness
I been down to my last match
Felt a hundered different demons
Breathing fire down my back
And I knew that if I stumbled
I'd fall right into the trap that they were laying, Yeah

But the good news
Is there's angels everywhere out on the street
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet
The one's that you been dragging for so long
You're on your knees
You might as well be prayin'
Guess what I'm saying
If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, If you're going through hell
Keep on moving, Face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

If you're going through hell
Keep on going, Don't slow down
If you're scared, don't show it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there

Yeah, If you're going through hell
Keep on moving, Face that fire
Walk right through it
You might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there
Yeah you might get out
Before the devil even knows you're there
Yeah

70,Little Big Town,21,Bring It On Home,2006,"

[Verse 1]
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
You got willing arms that'll hold you tight
A hand to lead you on through the night right here
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside
But don't you keep it to yourself

[Chorus]
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 2]
You know I know you like the back of my hand
But did you know I'm going to do all that I can right here
I'm going to lie with you till you fall asleep
When the morning comes I'm still going to be right here (yes I am)
So take your worries and just drop them at the door
Baby leave it all behind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby let me be your safe harbor
Don't let the water come and carry you away

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here

71,Kenny Rogers,22,I Can't Unlove You,2006,"

Postcards and letters
And pictures made to last forever
To be boxed up and tossed away
Knickknacks and souvenirs
In an afternoon, they're out of here
They'll disappear without a trace
But what they mean to me
Can never be replaced

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Interstates and old songs
Like time they go on and on
I guess I could learn to do the same
I could wake up without you
These two arms not around you
Tell myself it's meant to be this way
No matter how I try somethings I can't change

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, no
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

72,Eric Church,23,How 'Bout You,2006,"

[Verse 1]
I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock trying' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I aren’t got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 2]
I still say: ""Yes, Ma'am"" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red, White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 3]
I like my country rocking'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof
Hell, I might just stay all night long
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?

73,Sugarland,24,Down In Mississippi (Up To No Good),2006,"

[Verse 1]
Friday, payday, Lordy, got to get away
Had it with the wife thing, living on a shoe string
What's a poor girl got to do just to have some fun?
Well, all these years without any help
Guess what, honey, clothes just don't wash themselves!
Neither do dishes, neither does the bathroom floor

[Chorus]
So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
I'll be down in Mississippi and up to no good

[Verse 2]
No more, what a bore, had enough, I'm out the door
Headed for a breakdown, had it with the small town
Going to call Lisa, going to call Carla Sue
Now we're going to let it roll, going to let it rip
Going to get us a nice room down on the strip
Not that we'll need it, there won't be any sleeping tonight

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hammer down, here we go
Running for the riverboat
All you're going to see is asses and elbows
Luck's about to change for these three queens
Tired of getting jokers, deal us up kings

Snake eyes, roll the dice, double down and hit me twice
Cashing in the big chips, going to leave a big tip
Hotter than a two dollar pistol, baby, I'm on fire

Now you say you wanna polish me up

[Chorus]
Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now

[Verse 2]
I remember you used to like
Walking with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?

[Chorus]
Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now

Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?
You might start missing

I've got this spot where it don't get much better
Yeah, it's cold, it gets hot; I don't worry 'bout the weather
My private paradise don't fit the classifieds

Tennessee whiskey; Baby, are you with me?
Texas chili, Virginia pine
It's hard to beat that California sunshine

It feels just like I've died and gone to Heaven
Your lips, your eyes, hell everything gets me revvin'

We'd leave each other alone
We're just wastin' our time
We know it ain't right
There's no goin' back, but havin' said that:

I wish you would come over
An' drink my best bottle of wine
If you can lay on my shoulder
An' I can lean on you just one more time
You can mess up head
An' mess up my bed
An' leave before the mornin' light
I need your on again, off again, on again tonight

I don't expect things to change
We've got to get on with our lives
Space is a beautiful thing
When you need some room
I don't know about you, but I'm lonely right now:
I'm just thinkin' out loud

I wish you would come over
An' drink my best bottle of wine
You can lay on my shoulder
An' I can lean on you just one more time

She said, ""I need sometime to find myself
I need a little space to think
Maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way to fast for me.""
So, I, I picked up what was left of my pride
And I put on my walking shoes
And I got up on that high road
And I did what any gentleman would do..
I, um...

[Chorus: Holy]
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, I think I'm on to somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend

[Verse 2: Holy]
I love it when she calls me butter cup
Laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops and tosses me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When I get hungry, she takes me out
I ride the shotgun like a Shih Tzu hound
My tails a waggin', my tounge's hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...

[Chorus: Holy]
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach

Let's jump in my El Camino - Uh huh
Roll the windows down
Thought we could see what kind of trouble
We can find out on this messed up little town

The Boss on the radio- uh huh
Take whatever comes
We'll go flying down the highway with my arms around you singing Born To Run

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Oh It is almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should

Well you got your good looks - uh huh
And you got your style
And I'd drown here in this ccean
Just to have you float my boat for a while
I got a reputation - uh huh
Don't you worry about that
Just give me a chance and we'll never gonna ever look back

And it feels just like it should
It must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and rain that ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Man it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should

Maybe Romeo gets the girl this time
I guess everybody gets the chance to shine
And tonight is mine

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain it ain't never going to fall
Feels so good
Awww it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight
Right now, right here tonight
It feels just like it should

And tribulations
Of findin' Mr. Right

And the cheaters
And the cold mistreaters
To the mama's boys who can't make a stand

Raise your hand

Here's to findin' a good man

Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so
So would you go with me

[Verse 2]
Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me

84,Garth Brooks,35,That Girl Is A Cowboy,2006,"

[Verse 1]
It was a hundred and seven
We were heading to town
She had her sleeves rolled up
And the windows rolled down
That girl is a cowboy
Robert Earl was singing out
The ""Buckin' Song""
With every word that Keen was bringing
She was singing along
That girl is a cowboy

[Chorus]
Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

[Verse 2]
So I took her tout to show her
How to rope and ride
I can't believe that it was me
That wound up broke and tied
The girls is a cowboy
So that night I decided
We should paint the town
I made it home although
I really don't remember how
That girl is a cowboy

[Chorus]
Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

[Verse 3]
There's just something that a cowgirl has
Aren't no cowboy's got
Man she's something when she's one of the boys
But something else
Any time she's not

[Chorus]
Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

85,Megan Mullins,36,Ain't What It Used To Be,2006,"

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
An' my farm boy chased a city girl

I used to know everybody by name
But everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

I thought like my mom and her momma before
That I would die where I was born
Live a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies an' corn

Now here I am, one eye on the road
Tryin' to read the map on the dash
Nowhere close to makin' up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

No, this ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future now
Ain't what it used to be

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world

Was all I knew of the local lingo
That old pocket guide to Mexico
Wasn't much help to this out of place Gringo
When I checked into my motel room
Was helped by a brown-eyed senorita:
She said: ""Buen venidos, Senor: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
""Como esta. Buenos dias.""
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
""Boy you won't ever forget it.""
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

As I followed her down the hallway
I was tryin' my best not to stare
The angel before me was a rare beauty indeed
Jay-Lo had nothin' on her
She winked an' she smiled at me sweetly
Said: ""Senor, a qui esta sou mas vez
""Muy bappo,"" an' somethin' 'bout ""ho ho's.""
An' I thought: ""Oh, baby, whatever you say.""

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
""Boy you won't ever forget it.""
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

Later that evenin' in a local cantina
A Mariachi band was playin'
She held me close so her body would know
That my body knew what she was sayin'

I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
A little voice in my head said:
""Boy you won't ever forget it.""
They that Spanish is the language of love
Well, I love that it rolled off her tongue
I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it
No, I don't know what she said
But I sure liked the way that she said it

I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go
Oh

[Verse 2]
The Texas Sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams

[Chorus]
An I'll grab the wheel and point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas
And an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings

[Verse 3]
Mama said I never should have done it
Should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there
And he smiled inside and I pretended that I
Didn't notice a little tear that fell when I said I was going

[Chorus]

[Verse 4][Tag]
I've worried about life and
If it's arriving right on time
I guess if you don't jump
You'll never know if you can fly

90,Neal McCoy,41,The Last Of A Dying Breed,2006,"

My name's Tommy Franks, an' my Daddy's name was Ray
Ray was a farm boy, a cowboy an' a banker
A clerk, a roughneck, a driller
A long-haul driver, a soldier an' a mechanic
He was also a friend to everybody he ever met
Ray taught me the value of Faith an' family
The American flag, hard work, honesty an' a good dog
I hope my Daddy Ray wasn't the last of a dyin' breed

He's a cold beer drinker, a buck deer hunter:
The best friend a dog ever had
A post-hole-digger, a mint Skoal dipper
John Deere cap-sportin' man
With a house on a hill and a pond in the field
Surrounded by a mess of corn rows
Makes a livin' from his labour, a credit to the Maker
He's somebody everybody knows

Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
But if he goes, he will go down in history:
As the last, the last of the:

Overall wearers, farmer tan terrors
Down at the VFW hall. (y'all.)
Cake pan lickers, ripe tomato pickers
Hay balers loadin' trailers in the Fall
Fruit stand sellers, town square dwellers
Who gather at The Dairy Queen at dawn
Everybody knows him an' everybody loves him:
God, I'm gonna miss him if they're gone

Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
But if he goes, he will go down in history:
As the last, the last of a dying breed

(Last of a dying breed.)
He's a hard-working family man
(Last of a dying breed.)

Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
But if he goes, he will go down in history:
As the last, the last of a dying breed
Of a dying breed

91,Diamond Rio,42,God Only Cries,2006,"

On an icy road one night
A young man loses his life
They marked the shoulder with a cross
An' his family gathers round
On a piece of Hallowed ground
Their hearts are heavy with their loss
As the tears fall from their eyes
There's one who'll always sympathise

God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
An' all the angels up in Heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than, mmm, baby, than, oh
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home

It still makes me sad
When I think of my Grand-dad
I miss him each and every day
But I know the time will come
When my own gradnson
Wonders why I went away
Maybe we're not meant to understand
Till we meet up in the Promised Land

God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are left to carry on
And all the angels up in Heaven
They're not grieving because they're gone
There's a smile on their faces
'Cause they're in a better place than, oh, baby, than oh
God only cries for the living
'Cause it's the living that are so far from home
Yeah, we're so far from home, Mmmm, Mmmm

92,Sara Evans,43,Coalmine,2006,"

[Verse 1:]
Shotgun houses, shanty shacks
Countin' those ties on the railroad track
Thirty-four more, it's almost time
To see my baby walking out of that

[Chorus:]
Coalmine, covered with dust
T-shirt tired, all muscled up
All mine, head to toe
Come on, come on, whistle, blow

[Verse 2:]
I can't wait to get him home
Ain't gonna have nothing but the supper on
Gonna keep him busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
Some girls like them gussied up
Wearing all that smelly stuff
To me there's nothing quite so fine
As my man standing in front of that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Power's out, well that's all right
We'll make love by a miner's light
Gonna keep him busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
Shotgun houses, shanty shacks
Countrin' those ties on the railroad track
Just two more, it's almost time
To see my baby walking out of that

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Don't want no white-collared man
Midnight, I like calloused hands
To keep me busy 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine
I can't wait to get him home
Ain't gonna have nothing but the supper on
Power's out, well that's all right
We'll make love by a miner's light
Don't want no white-collared man
Midnight, I live calloused hands
To keep me bust 'til its time
He goes back to that coalmine

93,Cross Canadian Ragweed,44,This Time Around,2006,"

I used to be crazy, yeah, they called me a fool
Guess I wasn't myself back when I wanted you
Now youre comin round again, that same old look in your eye
Yea Id have to be crazy to fall again

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

I can't stay any longer
I gotta be on my way
Ive heard a thousand times
Everything that you gotta say

Show myself to the door
Ill turn out your light
Get back in my car
Youll be alone again tonight

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

Never thought Id be so cold
What did you expect me to do
I can't put it all on hold
I learned it all from you

Im gonna break these chains around my broken heart
You could have had it once, but you tore it all apart
Im gonna throw your lyin eyes over my left shoulder
Im not gonna let you wear your crown
This time around

Not this time around

94,Emerson Drive,45,A Good Man,2006,"

[Verse 1:]
I don't need a whole lot of money
But I wouldn't turn a lottery down
I just need a little green in my pocket
So I can buy my buddies a round
All I want is a place to lay my head with the woman I love lyin' in my bed
Kind of understated
My dreams aren't that complicated

[Chorus:]
I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife
And always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
I want everyone to gather ‘round
And say he was a father, brother, neighbour and a friend
He was a good man!

[Verse 2:]
I used to dream of being a rock star
And seein' the world in style
Used to dream of havin' a fast car
And driving that miracle mile
But I've heard tales those streets aren't paved in gold
They're full of pot holes and empty souls
Who never learn…
Love is something you gotta earn

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
When I'm gone, I wanna leave a legacy
Of love and laughs and honesty behind me
Behind me

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Yaaaaa…I wanna be a good man…a father
A brother, a neighbour, and a friend
I wanna be a good man!

95,Mark Wills,46,Hank,2006,"

Well, my old Uncle Joe, he's a proud Democrat
He's got FDR on his baseball cap
An' thinks the whole country's on a one-way track to hell
He says there's only one truck an' that's a Chevrolet
Everything else is money gone to waste
An' a lot more people oughtta learn to do for themselves
Well, I love how we can disagree
An' we can still be family

Makes me think about Hank
How he played his songs
Made a long-haired pot-smokin' hippy wanna sing along
Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads
There's a million you can pick
But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days
We're all crazy in our diff'rent ways
But we can all get along
Without everybody thinkin' the same

We got a big hair preacher on channel nineteen
A Maharaji on sixty-three
An' the good Lord's upstairs, tryin' to get them both on the phone
We got country boy's sayin' that rap just sucks
An' rappers sayin'country's all outta touch
But there's plenty of room for both on my radio
'Cause music ain't right or wrong
So tonight, let's just rock on an' on

Makes me think about Hank
How he played his songs
Made a long-haired pot-smokin' hippy wanna sing along
Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads
There's a million you can pick
But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days
We're all crazy in our diff'rent ways
But we can all get along
Without everybody thinkin' the same

(Aw, c'mon, yeah boy.)

Makes me think about life an' all it's different roads

But they're all gonna lead you back home
Yeah, we're livin' in some crazy days

Without everybody thinkin' the same
Yeah, the more things change
The more they stay the same

All the lights are goin' down on Main Street
Parkin' lots are fillin' up
With teenage dreams an' pick-up trucks
There's gonna be a race tonight:
That's where I'm gonna catch your eye
Right across that finish line is where I'll make you mine

An' if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Well then, baby, you can call me crazy
'Cause I do

This ol' GTO can't go no faster
There's only two ways out tonight:
Winnin' or disaster
Ain't nothin' but dust in my rear view
Oh, everybody's cheerin', baby
But all I want is you

And if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Well then, baby, you can call me crazy
'Cause I do

An' after the smoke has settled on this town
You're gonna know why true love won't back down
'Cause when wild hairs have turned to grey
I still will feel this way

And if it's crazy to think, maybe
All you need is a love that's true
Then call me crazy
'Cause I do

You can call me crazy
Ah, you can call me crazy
You can call me crazy

98,Rio Grand,49,Kill Me Now,2006,"

I can feel the battle waitin' on your lips with every kiss
It just don't feel like it used to
Late at night, when I hold you tight, something's just not right
There's a distance between me and you
Like I never knew
And it scares me to death to ask what's wrong
But if I'm about to lose you, baby, just go on…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what's going down
Baby, just kill me now

Lately you've been changing everything I love about you
It's like you're slowly fading
When the telephone rings I hear whispering from the other room
And my mind just goes crazy
Wondering, baby
Everyday is just another day growing apart from you
So if it's over just do what you gotta do…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what's going down
Baby, just kill me now

If you're already too far gone
To turn around
Have mercy on my heart…

And kill me now
You might as well go ahead and just lay me down
If you're really leaving heaven take me now
'Cause I wouldn't want to live without having you around
If that's what going down
If that's what going down
Baby, just kill me now
Baby, just kill me now

99,Dixie Chicks,50,Everybody Knows,2006,"

[Verse 1]
Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
Would you know me and see behind the smile
I can change like colors on a wall
Hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
I think I hide it all so well

[Chorus]
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Looking through the crowd
I search for something else
But every time I turn around
I run into myself
Here I stand
Consumed with my surroundings
Just another day
Of everybody looking
I swore they'd never see me cry
You'll never see me cry

[Chorus]
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

[Verse 3]
You say I'll pay the price
That's the chance that I'll take
Though you may think I'm telling lies
But I just call it getting by

[Chorus]
Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

100,Billy Currington,1,Good Directions,2007,"

[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens

101,Sugarland,2,Settlin',2007,"

[Verse 1]
Fifteen minutes left to throw me together
For mister right now, not mister forever
Don't know why i even try when i know how it ends
Looking like another ""maybe we could be friends""
I've been leaving it up to fate
It's my life so it's mine to make

[Chorus]
I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
Just enough ain't enough this time
I ain't settling for anything less than everything, yeah

[Verse 2]
With some good red wine and my brand new shoes
Gonna dance a blue streak around my living room
Take a chance on love and try how it feels
With my heart wide open yeah you know i will
Find what it means to be the girl
Who changed her mind and changed the world

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
Just enough ain't enough this time
I ain't settling for just getting by
I've had enough so so for the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low, so raise the bar high
I ain't settling no, no, no, no, no, no
So raise the bar high

102,Emerson Drive,3,Moments,2007,"

[Verse 1:]
I was coming to the end of a long, long walk
When a man crawled out of a cardboard box
Under the E Street Bridge
Followed me on to it
I went out halfway across
With that homeless shadow tagging along
So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway
He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
He said, You know, I haven't always been this way

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Verse 2:]
I stood there tryin' to find my nerve
Wondering if a single soul on Earth
Would care at all
Miss me when I'm gone
That old man just kept hanging around
Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there I felt ashamed
I said, You know, I haven't always been this way

[Chorus]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Bridge:]
I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
That old man tells his story one more time
He says

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge
When a young man almost ended it
I was right there, wasn't scared a bit
And I helped to pull him through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Outro:]
I've had my moments
I've had my moments
I've had my moments

I see her laying by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say

[Verse 2]
She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex

[Pre-Chorus]
And she'll go out dancing' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going
She's going downtown
I'm going downtown, too, and take a look around

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man

[Verse 3]
I'm just sitting 'round waiting on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy
[Chorus 2]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man, man

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can

Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man, no

You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless
Like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright

[Chorus]
Because when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend, till you break
Cause its all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands shake it off
Then you Stand, Then you stand

[Verse 2]
Life's like a novel
With the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon
With only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
Start holding on, keep holding on

[Chorus]
Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend till you break
Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand

Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place
Oh

Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

[Verse 2]
Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Verse 3]
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl
All over you when we get there is me

[Verse 4]
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Bridge]
Ooo, you never know where one might be
Ooo, there's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha

[Verse 5]
I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
I'd sure like to check you for ticks

Taken for granted

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

[Verse 2]
This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

[Verse 4]
This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Bridge]
When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 5]
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man I've been there
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare
Man I've been there
Man I've been there

108,Carrie Underwood,9,Wasted,2007,"

[Verse 1]
Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, ""I see the way out and I‘m gonna take it""

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don’t kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, ""It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it""

[Chorus]
'Cause I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Bridge]
She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floatin' side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'

Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted

"
109,Montgomery Gentry,10,Lucky Man,2007,"

[Verse 1]
I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood
I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got

[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Verse 2]
Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here

[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Outro]
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And even my bad days ain't that bad
Yeah, I'm a lucky man

[Outro]
I'm a lucky, lucky man

110,George Strait,11,Wrapped,2007,"

[Verse 1]
I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster, I hear your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away

[Chorus]
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

[Verse 2]
It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms
My God, you're smiling and you catch my eye
My heart is pounding deep inside

[Chorus]
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

[Verse 3]
Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster, I call your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Your pretty little finger
Baby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
Pretty little finger

111,Big & Rich,12,Lost In This Moment,2007,
112,Blake Shelton,13,Don't Make Me,2007,"

[Verse 1]
Girl when I look at you, you look through me
Like I'm not even there
I try not to give up, to be strong but
I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place, your heart is hidin'
I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fightin'

[Chorus]
Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

[Verse 2]
What if when I'm long gone, it dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear, if I leave here
It's done; I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
Well I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it

[Chorus]
Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me (Don't make me)

Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go)
Don't make me
Stop lovin' you

Stop needin' you

113,Keith Urban,14,I Told You So,2007,"

[Verse 1]
You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I to see you here tonight

[Chorus]
Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in our lives
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is heading in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be

[Chorus]
Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

[Verse ]
Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling

"
114,Jake Owen,15,Startin' With Me,2007,"

[Verse 1]
I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had wrung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

[Chorus]
If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things
Starting with me

[Verse 2]
I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks around here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standing by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma die

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1]
Quit my job, flipped off the boss, took my name off the payroll, screw you man
Picked up my cell, rang my baby's bell, said I'm three miles from home
I said, ""Sugar, won't you put on that sundress I like so much""
Wait out by the road, I'm comin' to pick you up

Throw your suitcase in the back

Done gassed up the Pontiac

Blastin' out to Johnny Cash
Headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back

It's four hundred and sixty-seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man who looks like Elvis, yeah Momma
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout tellin' your momma goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side

[Chorus]

1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!

[Verse 1]
I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say ""hahaha, hahaha""
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back

[Chorus]
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away

[Verse 2]
There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need
'Cause If I ain't got nothing
I'm footloose and fancy free

[Chorus]
1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away

Look at me so free
Nothings holding me down (down)
Look at me so free
Can't keep my feet on the ground

'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

118,Bucky Covington,19,A Different World,2007,"

We were born to mothers who smoked and drank
Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are
We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside

Chorus
It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

School always started the same every day
The pledge of allegiance then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right

Chorus

Bridge
No bottled water, we drank from a garden hose
And every Sunday, all the stores were closed

It was a different world

119,Rodney Atkins,20,These Are My People,2007,"

[Verse 1]
Well we grew up down by the railroad tracks
Shootin' BBs at old beer cans
Chokin' on the smoke from a Lucky Strike
Somebody lifted off of his old man
We were football flunkies
Southern rock junkies
Crankin' up the stereos
Singin' loud and proud to ""Gimme Three Steps,""
""Simple Man,"" and ""Curtis Loew""
We were good you know

[Verse 2]
Got some discount knowledge at the junior college
Where we majored in beer and girls
It was all real funny 'til we ran out of money
And they threw us out into the world
Yeah the kids that thought they'd run this town
Ain't runnin' much of anything
Just lovin' and laughin'
And bustin' our asses
And we call it all livin' the dream

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

[Verse 3]
Well we take it all week on the chin with a grin
Till we make it to a Friday night
And it's church league softball, holler 'bout a bad call
Preacher breakin' up the fight
Then later on at the Green Light Tavern
Well everybody's gatherin' as friends
And the beers are pourin' till Monday mornin'
And we start it all over again

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

[Bridge]
We fall down, and we get up
We walk proud, and we talk tough
We got heart, and we got nerve
Even if we are a bit disturbed

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
Ah nah

If I could win your heart
If you'd let me in your heart
I'd be so happy, baby
Just for these arms to be
Holding you close to me
There's nothing in this world I won't try
No limit to what I'd do to make you mine, 'cause

I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon

Living to give you love
I'd walk across this world just to be
Close to you 'cause I want you close to me, yeah

Sometimes I think about you
Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And would you even recognize
The woman that your little girl has grown up to be?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I look in the mirror, and all I see
Are your brown eyes, lookin' back at me
They're the only thing, you ever gave to me at all

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

[Verse 2]
I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did you think I didn't need you here?
To hold my hand, to dry my tears
Did you even miss me, through the years at all?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

Forgiveness
Is such a simple word
But it's so hard to do
When you've been hurt

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
And just in case, you're wonderin' about me
From now on, I won't be in Carolina
Your little girl is off... your little girl is off...
Your little girl is off to Tennessee

122,Craig Morgan,23,Tough,2007,"

She's in the kitchen at the crack of dawn
Bacon's on, coffee's strong
Kids running wild, taking off their clothes
If she's a nervous wreck, well it never shows
Takes one to football and one to dance
Hits the Y for aerobics class
Drops by the bank, stops at the store
Has on a smile when I walk through the door
The last to go to bed, she'll be the first one up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out
There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

We sat there five years ago
The doctors let us know, the test showed
She'd have to fight to live, I broke down and cried

She held me and said it's gonna be alright
She wore that wig to church
Pink ribbon pinned there on her shirt
No room for fear, full of faith
Hands held high singing Amazing Grace
Never once complained, refusing to give up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out
There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

She's a gentle word, the sweetest kiss
A velvet touch against my skin
I've seen her cry, I've seen her break
But in my eyes, she'll always be strong

There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Standin' still on the interstate
An' I swear some old lady
Just flipped me the bird
Did she just flip me the bird?

Ha ha, it's gotta go up from here
Today is gonna disappear
An' nothin's gonna interfere, whoa, oh
Gonna buy myself some flowers
An' then spend a couple a-hours
Talkin' to my Higher Power, whoa, oh
Ask Him why life's this way
(Ask Him why.)
Yeah, I'm gonna ask Him why my life's this way
(Why's my life this way?)
There's just no tellin' what He's gonna say
Oh, it's just that kind of day

129,Jason Michael Carroll,30,Livin' Our Love Song,2007,"

Baby when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby blues
Standing there across the room I get so lost in the way you move
It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man
So many things have come so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

{Chorus}
Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out
Living our dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are
I just want to lay you down
Say I love you without a sound
I think you know what I'm talking about

{Chorus}

{Chorus}

Feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just living our love song

130,Terri Clark,31,Dirty Girl,2007,"

Four wheels churning up a fresh green pasture
Throwing mud pies everywhere
I'm beside you yellin' faster faster
Wind whippin' through my tangled hair and you know
You know
There's nothin' like it in the world
When your out there underneath the sun
And I'm a dirty girl
I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string of pearls
And when we hang out it's
It's just a fun day
You know I love it when I get to be a dirty girl

Chorus: dirty girl
You'll be workin' on that El Camino
Bustin' knuckles with a monkey wrench
I'll come sneakin' up
And whisper real low
What you really need is a 3/16ths
And you know that there's nothin' like it in the world
When were underneath the hood and I'm a dirty girl

I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string of pearls
Or when we hang out it's
It's just a fun day you know
I love it when I get to be a dirty girl

Chorus:dirty girl
And you know, you know that there's nothing like it in the world
It might be axle grease and Mississippi mud
But when you touch my cheek and leave a little smudge
I'LL BE YOUR DIRTY GIRL
I like it when we get cleaned up on Sunday
Feel my skin against a string pearls
Or when we hang out and it's
It's just a fun day
You know I love it when I get to be a dirty
Get to be a dirty girl

Chorus:dirty girl
I get to be a dirty girl

131,Trace Adkins,32,I Wanna Feel Something,2007,"

[Verse 1]
If you're telling me I'm not on fire
You're just preaching to the choir
I've gotten dull as old barbed wire from living
Last night I watched the evening news
It was the same old, nothing new
It should have cut me right in two
But it didn't
I don't know why it didn't

[Chorus]
But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

[Verse 2]
If you're telling me that's just how it is
I don't buy it because once I was kissed
By a red-headed girl with cherry lips
On her porch when I was sixteen
And I felt it somewhere in my soul and time stood still and I couldn't let go
I can't tell you because I don't know how I got so cold
When did I get so cold

[Chorus]
But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

[Verse 3]
I hate that I'm jaded and I make you cry
But still you stick around me, only God knows why
Damn it all to hell, I'm done
Because I don't like what I've become
So come here, baby
Come here, baby

[Chorus]
But I want to feel something
Something that's a real something
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I want a heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's busting at the seams
I want to care, I want to cry, I want to scream
I just want to feel something

[Outro]
Come here, baby

Oh, look there you go again, puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this  an' doin' that, always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take

[Pre-Chorus]
But you can only be strong so long before you break

[Chorus]
So, fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall

[Verse 2]
Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder and let it fade away
And if you wanna let go, baby, it's okay

[Chorus]
Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine, I'll catch you
Every time you...
Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

[Verse 1]
I never had all the answers
I never had enough time
But I sure had all the reasons
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

[Verse 2]
I never laid all my cards out
You just wanted to play
The king, he waited on my doorsteps
While the joker and me went on our way

[Chorus]
Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

[Verse 3]
These days everything is all business
Never in one place for too long
But there's no lack of arms around me
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong

[Chorus]
Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee
In Tennessee

[Bridge]
And I'd wish on every star in the southern sky
For that man and our life if I did not think that

[Chorus]
Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

Yes, I guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

Confetti falling from the sky
My hometown on the 4th of July
A midnight snow on Christmas Eve
Like standing up for what you believe

[Chorus]
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel
That's how I feel when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Your lucky coat, the first day of fall
When you wake up laughing just because
An old church door that stays wide open
A perfect heart that's never been broken

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
That's how I feel when I'm with you
Every day there's something new
To cry about, to laugh about
Those moments I can't live without
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
When I'm with you

135,Dusty Drake,36,Say Yes,2007,"

We've only known each other since the moment we met
But it seems like forever to me
I haven't figured out the perfect way to say it yet
But I suppose at times like these
A man should get down on his knees

How'd ya like to be in my wedding
How'd ya like to walk down the isle
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin
All ya have to do is say, ""Yes""

Your folks could be seated in the very front row
And cry when we all turn to look at you
We could cut the cake
And we could strike a pose
Like the little bitty plastic bride and groom

And then begin our life-long honeymoon

How'd ya like to be in my wedding
How'd ya like to walk down the isle
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin'
All ya have to do is say, ""Yes""

Say, ""Yes""
Say, ""Yes""

Please say, ""Yes""

136,Jack Ingram,37,Measure Of A Man,2007,"

I was fifteen left home young
Tore up the tracks and then some
Me and my dad didn't see eye to eye
I never took to him
He never took the time
Bullet proof
More than tough
Smarter than he ever was

Well I burned those wheels down the highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Do the best you can do
Love many trust few
Work hard for the money in your hands
Thats the measure of a man
Yeah the measure of a man

Anger burns, love cools it down
Pretty young woman turned my head around
The world through her eyes looked so different

She lives on faith, she looks for forgiveness
Fool proof, it ain't easy
I need her, she needs me

She stole my heart on this highway
She taught me to love through the hard days
Yeah she's cool when I'm not, she's as steady as a rock
She's as solid as the ring on my hand
That's the measure of a man
Yeah the measure of a man

Last night she handed me a son of my own
It killed me to do it, but I picked up the phone

Hey dad I burned ten years down this highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Truth is I need you, we'll cry if we need to
And I'll swallow my pride if you can
That's the measure of a man
Oh yeah, the measure of a man

They say life is so much sweeter
Through the telephoto lens of fame
Around here you get just as much attention
Cheering at the high school football game
I dreamed of going to Nashville
Put my money down and place my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page of the ""Turner Town Gazette""

[Chorus]
Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town

Tyler and Casey broke up
It ended pretty quietly
We heard he was caught red-handed with her mama
So that's just what they let us all believe

Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey word's gonna get around

Baby who
Needs their faces in a magazine
Me and you
We've been stars of the town since we were 17

[Verse 4]
Let's go on down to the quick stop
Wear your yellow shades
And I'll put on my tight jeans
And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber
And we'll let 'em point and stare in disbelief

[Chorus]
'Cause every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail

Somebody I love just up and left
And if I know her, she'll drive all night alone
And she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

Just in case she ain't that far from town
Play somethin' that'll turn her car around
And send it out from a fool who's done her wrong
Hey, she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

[Chorus]
Play something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind, tugs at her heart

Well, I know you get this all the time
Broken hearts lighting up all the lines
Begging you to play that special song
Hey, but she just might have her radio on
Yeah, I pray she has her radio on

So play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart

I need to make a dedication
Before that late-night signal's faded
Before she drives away too far
And parks that damned old car

Play her something that'll get her thinking 'bout me
Let her know I'm really sorry
Something that reaches out in the dark
Weighs on her mind and tugs at her heart
Tears up her eyes, turns 'round the car

She got her daddy's tongue and temper
Sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
Oh, but I bet he smiled
She loves and lives her life, unruly
Tears up that dirt road up in a dually
Dangerous, absolutely
And in a little while
She'll be rounding that corner on three wheels
Ain't slowing down, yelling, ""Come on, jump in""
Always up to something, crazy, got nothing on her

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

She says she wants to meet my momma
I said, ""I don't think you ought a
Be like mixing oil and water""
But by midnight, she had
Momma on the coffee table, dancing
Coming unwound
Good God, I swear, can't take her anywhere
What's the girl going to do next?

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

Every once in a while, she gives me that smile
And says, ""I just don't see somebody like you
Loving somebody like me""

Thought she was faster, cause I told her so, even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

There in the back pew of a Sunday morning church
The preacher preachin' Gospel, well that's when I gave her her first kiss
She told me so even though it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel even though she ain't got wings
'Cause my sweet Daisy loved the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin
She led me down to the river, said you need to be Baptized
Held me under the moon light, Lord I don't know why
She loved the hell outta me

Eight years later we got married, and the day her water broke
The doctor said there's complications, but I still had hope
She was gonna make it 'cause she told me so, even thought it wasn't quite the truth
Well I know she's an angel, and now she's got her wings
Yeah, my sweet Daisy loves the hell outta me

She gave me her body, she gave me her soul, didn't ask for nothin
She led me down to the river, said you need to be Baptized

When you rolled out of bed and stubbed your toe
And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
Yeah, that minivan's a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job is pushing back
Vacation more, it seems
You got soccer at four-thirty
And ballet class by five
Then I call you talking flirty
You ask have I lost my mind

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper, honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

If I had to do the things you do
Well, I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get 'em fed and bathed
And settled down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're laying down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches
Over them and you and me

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh

If you stay, hey, I got a plan

Another sun I never thought I'd see rise
High heel hopes and whiskey lies
Ohhh-hoo
Feels like a freight train is running right though my head
My little black dress smells like cigarettes
A Napkin with no name, just an address
Had me a good time... I guess

How am I gunna get my life together
As old as its gettin' it ain't gettin' any better
I don't know where to start
I'm fallin' so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddy's just worried 'bout his baby
How am I supposed to straighten up and fly right
When I don't even remember what I did last night

Shelly said she saw me hanging on an astronaut... not
Lettin him lie though his teeth cause his smile was hot
I'm sittin here suckin' down second thoughts

A little hair of the dog... i know this has got to stop

How am I gunna get my life together
As old as its gettin' it ain't gettin' any better
I don't know where to start
I'm falling so far behind
Mama says I gotta start acting like a lady
Daddy's just worried 'bout his baby

Missing Years
By Little Texas

Bet you never thought you'd see me, round these parts again
Cause five minutes after graduation I blew out of here like the wind
Was the first one in four generations to think that there had to be something more
And whatever I was missing, it damn sure worth looking for
So I hit the road, long and lonesome road

I got lost in Arizona, trying to find my place in the sun
Met a girl in Oklahoma, turns out she was not the one
Made my way to the Carolina's, wondered up and down the coast
Till it dawned on me, what I'd left right here
And what I'd been missing, in my missing years

It's the smell of the morning coffee, at the Liberty Cafe
Smile and in a way from old Sunny, like I hadn't missed a day
Well it sure ain't much to look at, just a dusty drive through town
But the roots that run beneath it, are what make it scared ground
I've seen enough to know, what make a place a home

Cause I got lost in Arizona, trying to find my place in the sun
Met a girl in Oklahoma, turns out she was not the one
Made my way to the Carolina's, wondered up and down the coast
Till it dawned on me, what I'd left right here
And what I'd been missing, in my missing years

Made my way from the Carolina's, to this one lane gravel road
Cause it dawned on me, what I left right here

There wasn't even a cloud up in the sky
After thirteen years at the factory they sorry mam but we're downsizin
That's the way life is, good luck with the rest of it
She looked me in the eye and said this ain't the first time I've taken the fall
But let me tell you girl what's gotten me through is keepin faith through it all

Cause there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes

Everybody said you gotta give it up
You can't keep that child, It's just too tough at seventeen, You're just a baby
Well she cried and she prayed, made up her mind
Said this beautiful life that's growin inside needs a chance to have a hand in God's plan
Everyone told her they'd never by, well he just turned sixteen
Made it straight to the top of his class, the captain of the football team

Yeah, there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
God don't make mistakes

Oh, there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase
There's a reason to keep believin
Keep believin!
God don't make mistakes!

Yeah, yeah
Oh, God don't make mistakes!

"
150,Brad Paisley,1,I'm Still A Guy,2008,"

[Verse 1]
When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 4]
These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy

[Outro]
Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy

"
151,Phil Vassar,2,Love Is A Beautiful Thing,2008,"

Looks like everybody's here
Had to put some foldin' chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world

Pre Chorus

And all them kids jumpin' in the pews
And Mr. Charlie in his lime-green suit
'Is a handsome man'
Remarks Widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go

Chorus

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love is a beautiful thing

2nd Verse

Daddy's waitin' with the bride
Yeah, she helps him with his tie
She sees a tear
He says, 'Man, it's hot in here' hmm
He hugs his little girl and asks
'How did you grow up so fast?
God, I wish your Momma could be here for this'

Pre Chorus

And everybody stands and smiles
As she goes walkin' down the aisle
In her Momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago
And said their vows
Yeah, I guess it's workin' out

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

A little table full'a gifts
Catering's covered dish
And the wedding band
Well, that's on her hand
And Tommy's teasin' Lorelei
He pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows
A day will come

Tag Chorus

When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher gets to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love
Two people in love is a beautiful thing

Just Got Started Lovin You
(James Otto / Jim Femino / D. Vincent Williams)
You dont have to go now honey
Call and tell em you wont be in today
Baby there aint nothin at the office
So important it cant wait
Im thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just aint gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
Whats the point in fightin what were feelin
We both know well never win
Aint this what were missin
Lets just stop all this resistin and give in
Let me wrap my arms around you
You know you dont want to leave this room
Come back and let me hold you darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
What can I say Ive never felt this way
Girl youre like a dream come true
After all the love weve made
It sure would be a shame
If we let this moment end so soon
So wont you lay back down beside me
Girl just like I know youre wantin to
Trust me when I tell you darlin
Girl I just got started lovin you
Im thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just aint gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin

153,Rascal Flatts,4,Every Day,2008,"

[Verse 1]
You could have bowed out gracefully
But you didn't
You knew enough to know
To leave well enough alone
But you wouldn't
I drive myself crazy
Trying to stay out of my own way
The messes that I make
But my secrets are so safe
The only one who gets me
Yeah, you get me
It's amazing to me

[Chorus]
How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life

[Verse 2]
I come around all broken down and
Crowded out
And you're comfort
Sometimes the place I go
Is so deep and dark and desperate
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]
How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I swear, I don't know if
I'm coming or going
But you always say something
Without even knowing
That I'm hanging on to your words
With all of my might and it's alright
Yeah, I'm alright for one more night-
Every day
Every day, every day, every day
Every day, every day
You save me, you save me, oh, oh, oh
Every day
Every, every, every day-

Every day you save my life

154,Lady Antebellum,5,Love Don't Live Here,2008,"

[Verse 1]
Well, this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, when I would curse your name
Hey!
Well I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Well baby, you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
Oh, should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore

[Bridge]
Oh no
That love don't live here anymore

[Outro]
Oh no, no
Sugar no, no
And you don't live here anymore
And love don't live here anymore
And since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here, girl
Oh, love don't live here anymore

155,George Strait,6,I Saw God Today,2008,"

[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 508
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splashing down from mounting in shades of red

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today

156,Carrie Underwood,7,Last Name,2008,"

[Verse 1]
Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!

[Verse 2]
We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

[Bridge]
Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

[Chorus 2]
I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no! What have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name

[Breakdown]
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh

[Outro]
It started off, ""Hey cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah

157,Kenny Chesney,8,Better As A Memory,2008,"

[Verse 1]
I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Verse 2]
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Bridge]
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

[Verse 3]
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man

158,Taylor Swift,9,Picture To Burn,2008,"

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

159,Montgomery Gentry,10,Back When I Knew It All,2008,"

[Verse 1]
At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""Tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Verse 2]
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Bridge]
I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus 1]
Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

[Chorus 3]
Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home

[Verse]
Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a coming
It'll be here before too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl that's kind of what I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door

Train's a coming, river's running
Train's a coming, river's running
Pain's a coming, tears are running
Yeah that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving

She's sitting by the water where the river gets wide
Think about swimming to the other side
Got a Malboro red, and a can of cold Bud
Toes squished down in the Arkansas mud

[Verse 2]
Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her
Son, you ought to see her sister!
You've got to give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that
Hottie, she's a Hottie! Got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey

[Verse 3]
She's slapping down a dam
Where the moss gets thick
Yelling Yee Haw! she's a redneck chick
Spitting in the fire, putting on a show
Strutting like a chicken to the radio
Hey Slick! She's a hick!
Hmm and her butter milk lipstick
Give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that

Hottie, she's a Hottie! She got a smokin' little body

[Verse 1]
I guess you could say I'm one of those girls
Who's always been with one of those guys
You know the type
Like right now, he sleeps while I write
But it's better than crying
Warn out from trying
From loving a man who always makes it clear
I am not welcome here
Just till he's horney or hungry or needs something clean
You know what I mean
But not tonight
Cause come the morning light, oh

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman in me

[Verse 2]
Light bulbs buzz, I get up
Head to my drawer
Wish there was more
I could say
Another fairy tale fades to grey
I've lived on hope
Like a child
Walking that mile
Faking that smile
All the while
Wishing my heart had wings
Well from now on I'm gonna be
The kind of woman I'd want my daughter to be, oh

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me
Even if someone can't see
A stronger woman in me
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again
Never, no
Cause there's a stronger woman
A stronger woman

[Bridge]
This is me packing up my bags
This is me headed for the door
This is me, the best you ever had

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
Believe in me, even if someone can't see
The a stronger woman in me
Gonna be my own best friend
Stick with me till the end
Won't lose myself again, no, no
Cause there's a stronger woman, stronger woman
There's a stronger woman, stronger woman in me
Stronger woman in me

I just walked in and you were gone
To your Mama's I suppose
It looks like you won't be back so I thought you ought to know
I found that note you left today it only took you half a page
I'm going to grab my old guitar take a pencil from the jar and fill in the empty space

Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do

In each line you're going to hear it's my fault and I miss you
I know it won't be in time it may not even rhyme
But it has to be is true

[Chorus]
I'm going to tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm going to tell you how I feel, straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of ninety proof and write a song for you like Kristofferson would do

[Outro]
I'm going to drink this bottle of ninety proof and sing this song for you
Like Kristofferson would do

166,Josh Turner Featuring Trisha Yearwood,17,Another Try,2008,"

[Verse 1]
All the things I felt and never shared
All the times she was lonely with me there
Tears I wouldn't let fall from my eyes
And how I let her go without a fight

[Chorus]
The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try

[Verse 2]
There is no changing things that we regret
The best that we can hope for is one more chance
If the hands of time could just move in reverse
I wouldn't make the same mistake again with her

The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try

The reasons I`m alone I know by heart
But I don`t want ti spend forever in the dark
I swear next time I`ll hang on for dear life
If love ever gives me another try

[Outro]
Oh if love ever gives me another try

167,Miranda Lambert,18,Gunpowder And Lead,2008,"

[Verse 1]
County road 233 under my feet
Nothing on this white rock but little ol’ me
I've got two miles 'till he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell

[Chorus]
I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

[Verse 2]
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

[Bridge]
His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

[Chorus]
I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead

168,Reba McEntire With Kenny Chesney,19,Every Other Weekend,2008,"

[Verse 1: Reba McEntire & Kenny Chesney]
Every other Friday
It's toys and clothes and backpacks
Is everybody in?
Okay, let's go see dad
Same time in the same spot
Corner of the same old parking lot
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad
We trade a couple of words and looks and kids again
Every other weekend
Every other weekend
Very few exceptions
I pick up the love we made in both my arms
It's movies on the sofa, grilled cheese and cut the crust off
""That's not the way mom makes it, daddy,"" breaks my heart
I miss everything I use to have with her again
Every other weekend

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney, Reba McEntire, Both]
But I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Because there's too many questions and ears in the car
So I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's (He's) over me, that's where we are
So we're as close as we may ever be again
Every other weekend

[Verse 2; Reba McEntire & Kenny Chesney]
Every other Saturday
First thing in the morning
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away
I know why, but I don't know why
We ever let this happen
Falling for forever was a big mistake
There's so much not to do and all day not to do with him
Every other weekend
Every other Sunday
I empty out my backseat
While my children hug their mother
In the parking lot
We don't touch
We don't talk much
Maybe goodbye to each other
As she drives away with every piece of heart I got
I re-convince myself we did the right thing
Every other weekend

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney, Reba McEntire, Both]
But I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Because there's too many questions and ears in the car
So I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's (He's) over me, that's where we are
So we're as close as we may ever be again
Every other weekend
Yeah for fifteen minutes we're family again
God I wish that he was still with me again
Every other weekend

169,Keith Anderson,20,I Still Miss You,2008,"

I've changed the presets in my truck
So those old songs don't sneak up
They still find me and remind me
Yeah you come back that easy
Try restaurants I've never been to
Order new things off the menu
That I never tried 'cause you didn't like
But two drinks in, and you're by my side

I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinking
I've been strong and I've been weak
And I still miss you
I've done everything move on like I'm supposed to
I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you
I still miss you baby

I never knew til you were gone
How many pages you were on
It never ends I keep turning
And line after line and you are there again
I dont know how to let you go
You are so deep down in my soul
I feel helpless so hopeless
Its a door that never closes
No I don't know how to do this

I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinking
I've been strong and I've been weak
And I still miss you
I've done everything
Move on like I'm supposed to
I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you yeah

I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinking
I've been strong and I've been weak

170,Josh Gracin,21,We Weren't Crazy,2008,"

We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought ""maybe we didn't think it through""
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(chorus)
We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong

Lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy

(repeat chorus)
Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away
Took a chance on that feeling
We were lovin blind, borderline reckless
We were livin for the minute we were spinning in
Maybe we were a lot of things
Oh maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
We weren't crazy
We weren't crazy

171,Brooks & Dunn,22,Put A Girl In It,2008,"

[Verse 1]
You can buy you a brand new truck
Chrome it all out, jack it way up
You can build you a house up high on a hill
With a pool and a pond and a view to kill
You can make all the money in sight
But you ain't living the good life

[Chorus]
Until you put a girl in it
You ain't got nothin
What's it all worth
Without a little loving
Put a girl in it
Some huggin and some kissin
If you're world's got somethin missin
Just put a girl in it

[Verse 2]
You can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis
Have some fun in the sun, float around in the breeze
You can lay out on a blanket by the lake
Drink a cold beer, polish off another day
Kick on back and watch the sky turn red
A sunset ain't a sunset

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can write you a country song
The DJ won't put it on
They won't dance or sing along

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you're ridin in your truck
Put a girl in it
If you're going to have a party
Put a girl in it
If you want to live the good life
Better put a gir-r-rl in it

172,Gary Allan,23,Learning How To Bend,2008,"

I'm still learning how to pray
Trying hard not to stray
Try to see things your way
I'm still learning how to pray
I'm still learning how to trust
It's so hard to open up
And I'd do anything for us
I'm still learning how to trust

I'm still learning how to bend
How to let you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'm just trying to understand
It's all in someone else's hands
There's always been a bigger plan
But I don't need to understand

I'm still learning how to bend
I wanna take you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend

I'm still learning how to bend
I'll be there till the end
I'm still learning how to bend

173,Joe Nichols,24,It Ain't No Crime,2008,"

I was sittin' outside in the front yard
Lawn chair, kiddie pool, just soakin' up the sun
Old man walks by and said
We got this thing called ambition
Why don't you buy a suit
And go get you some

Like he ain't got enough of his own business
Now he's got to go mindin' mine
Opportunity knocks and I miss it
It ain't no crime
It ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and kill a little time
It ain't no crime

I was gettin' some pink in my color
Next door lady says, why you always layin' 'round
Fine you man like you
Should be married with some children
Instead of all those honeys
Running in and out

Like she ain't got enough of her own business
Now she's got to go mindin' mine
I don't have a lot of kids and a Mrs
It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and steal a kiss some time
It ain't no crime

If everybody minded their own business
They'd be too busy to worry 'bout mine
If I live life the way I wanna live it
It ain't no crime, it ain't no crime
If I wanna kick back and chill or steal
A kiss from a girl, I will every time
It ain't no crime
It ain't no crime

174,Trisha Yearwood,25,This Is Me You're Talking To,2008,"

This was bound to happen
It was just a matter of time
This town is just too small for
Us to really say goodbye
You're smiling that smile that
You get when you're nervous
Like you don't quite know what to do
But this is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to

I've heard you met somebody
It didn't take you very long
And I'll admit it isn't easy
Knowing you've moved on
But I can see how you could make any woman
Fall deep in love with you
This is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

We don't have to do this
We don't have to act like friends
As much as I would love to
I really just don't think I can
You don't have to tell me that you really love me
After all we have been through
'Cause this is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

Oh, and you don't have to say that you do
This is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to

175,Jason Michael Carroll,26,I Can Sleep When I'm Dead,2008,"

I got a little game that I play
And I call it ""Try to beat the morning paper home""
I ain't very good but I get a lot of practice
Even won once a month ago
Of course there was a girl involved that wasn't gonna let me rest
But I've always said I can sleep when I'm dead

[Chorus]
If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
Ya gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet
Like I said I can sleep when I'm dead

It ain't no fun if ya ain't got money
So I always make it in to work
The trick is to leave at least a half an hour
To brush my teeth and change my shirt
Keep a closet full of Red Bull and Visine to hide the red
I don't need the rest, I can sleep when I'm dead

[Chorus]
When I get tired, I'll go to bed
All that I can say is that it hasn't happened yet

If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
Ya gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet
Like I said I can sleep when I'm dead
Like I said
Like I said
I can sleep when I'm dead

176,The Lost Trailers,27,Holler Back,2008,"

I got a city folk friend in a hip-hop world
He goes by E. Diddy but his name is Earl
Cocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride
Pumpin' nothin' but bass

He says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'
And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

When he says
'Holler back when you get back home'
I say, 'The only holler back that I know is'

(Chorus)
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

Take a left off the Interstate
Go ten miles
Take a right on Farm Road 99
And just roll 'til the blacktop ends

'Ya see Mary Jo rockin' that front porch swing
Bikini top and them cut-off jeans
And that's where Hillbilly Heaven begins

Ah, she'll pour 'ya some of that cherry wine
Boy, you're guaranteed to have yourself
One hell of a time
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it so good
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds 'a get sown
It's a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Let out a howl if 'ya feel like 'ya gotta
If you wanna go on back to the holler
Holler back

Where the wild seeds a get sown
Its a blast from the past
All the cowgirls shakin' their sassafras
Homebrewed, homegrown
Where the wild seeds a get sown)

And through an open window came like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away, away

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

They sat on the stony ground and he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
It was the winter 1963, it felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy and the Beatles, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
They shut the factory down
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

The evening had turned to rain, watched the water roll down the drain
As they followed him down to the station
And he would never wave goodbye, you could see it written in his eyes
As the train pulled out of sight, bye, bye

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma ma ma, take it easy on yourself

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night

The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)

I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day

You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah, and me, I'm missing you way across town
So do you believe me now?

I'm kicking myself
For being the one foolish enough
Giving him the chance to step in my shoes
Oooh
He was biding his time
When he saw our love was having a moment of weakness
He was there between us

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby

Gotta go, even though it's not what he wants to do
But he does it, some things never change

In a world that keeps turnin' and movin' so fast
When you can't hold on to nothin' and nothin' seems to last
It's so good to know that love still remains
Ain't you glad that some things never change?

Three o'clock every afternoon waitin' by the door
Sees her babies are runnin' off the bus, she couldn't love 'em any more
Yeah, yeah, oh, some things never change

Like when I'm lyin' next to you, well, I remember when
Your kisses made me crazy so beautiful back then
And I still feel the same, yeah, some things never change

Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

Someone to say it's gonna be alright
A good friend and a glass of wine
A little pick me up to get me through the night
We talk trash n' we laugh and cry
That kind of therapy money can't buy
Every now and then, every now and then
Every girl needs a good friend and a glass of wine

I don't need to jet off to no vacation for a week
I'd be happy to have a happy hour
When I'm tired and I'm fried it gets me right back on my feet
Any kind of red or white, a little sister time
It's every smart girls secret

Sidewalk flyin' beneath my bike
A five year-old's first taste
Of what freedom's really like
He was runnin' right beside me
His hand holdin' on the seat
I took a deep breath and hollered
As I headed for the street

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Oh, I think I'm ready
To do this on my own
It's still a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go

I was standin' at the altar
Between the two loves of my life
To one I've been a daughter
To one I soon would be a wife
When the preacher asked
‘Who gives this woman?'
Daddy's eyes filled up with tears
He kept holdin' tightly to my arm
‘Till I whispered in his ear

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Oh, I think I'm ready
To do this on my own
It still feels a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go

It was killin' me to see
The strongest man I ever knew
Wastin' away to nothin'
In that hospital room
‘You know he's only hangin' on for you'
That's what the night nurse said
My voice and heart were breakin'
As I crawled up in his bed, and said

You can let go now, Daddy
You can let go
Your little girl is ready
To do this on my own
It's gonna be a little bit scary
But I want you to know
I'll be ok now, Daddy
You can let go
You can let go

[Verse 1]
I toss and turn, I'm losin' sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wanderin' around in circles, in a daze

[Verse 2]
Just when I start awakening
I find that somethin's intoxicatin' me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

[Chorus 1]
I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless

[Verse 3]
Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reachin' out to me

[Chorus 1]
I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless

[Chorus 2]
I can't fight it
There's no hidin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless

[Bridge]
I'm starin' at a hurricane
A hundred miles of drivin' rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
'Cause I can't outrun it

[Interlude]

[Chorus 1]
I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless

[Chorus 2]
I can't fight it
There's no hidin'
Girl, your love is
Relentless

[Verse 1 recap]
I toss and turn, I'm losin' sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wanderin' around in circles, in a daze

[Verse 2 recap]
Just when I start awakening
I find that somethin's intoxicatin' me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

187,Garth Brooks,38,Midnight Sun,2008,"

[Verse 1]
Ain't no hay left on the ground
Going to join the sun in sitting down
My last bale and well my tail is dragging
Cotton shirt, Cotton mouth
Cold ones waiting at the house
It's time for me to get down off the wagon

[Chorus]
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
A jukebox and swinging doors
Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

[Bridge]
Find a looker, have her hold my keys
And tell her later we'll be needing these
Grab a cold one, turn it upside down
To that honky tonking sound

[Chorus]
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Because eight o' clock comes twice a day
And either way you'll find me chasing strays
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

[Verse 2]
Shoot the breeze while shooting pool
Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends
The party never ends

[Chorus ]
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Looky there who waits for me
Smiling sweetly, holding up my keys
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

[Outro]
In the land of the midnight sun

188,Darius Rucker,39,Don't Think I Don't Think About It,2008,"

[Verse 1]
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said I'd enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

[Verse 2]
When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man, and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today?
If I never drove that car away

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

No no
Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't

189,Jo Dee Messina,40,I'm Done,2008,"

You and me we had a pretty good thing
We were makin' plans, we were planning our dreams
Then you had to go and let her back in
Boy, you oughta know that's where the trouble begins

She don't love you, she's just pullin' your chain
Don't you know you're like her puppet on a string?

Now she's walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

She's the kinda girl that's a good for nothin'
Leaves a path of destruction everywhere that she goes
What you see in her, well I'll never know
She's the kinda trash you find beside of the road

She don't love you, she's just messin' your mind
And you snap back, no slack, right back to her every time

Now she's walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

Oh, you had to scratch that itch
You deserve what you get, yeah, you and that

Walkin' around, talk of the town, she just can't shut up
Oh, she's out there and she's a havin' her fun
Spendin' her time, wastin' mine, provin' that she has you
Well, the truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done
Truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done
The truth is she don't have to, she can have you, I'm done

Girl you got me going
Yea I think you know it
Oh I'm ready for this ride
So come on take my hand
Cuz only you, you understand
How to kick this feeling into

Drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you

If life is what you make it
Here's my chance ill take it
You know I wanna make you mine
I have this picture in my mind
You were in it all the time
So baby hold on tight

And drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light

191,Emily West,42,Rocks In Your Shoes,2008,"

So you had some bad luck, life sucks, can't do nothing right
You took some wrong turns, got burned way too many times
And so you fall back with all that hurt that just don't wanna heal

So then you do the, ""Why me? This can't be happening again
Hey, what's the deal? Man, I can't take much more of this""
You put your time in, paid your dues, believe me, I know how you feel

I guess you gotta make a choice when it hits the fan
You can get a little down or get a little mad
When there's stones in the road only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rocks in your shoes, come on!

I heard some good lies from bad guys making their mark
They did a drive by, bang bang, big hole in my heart
Needed a crash cart, CPR sister, I was fading fast

I had a poor me trophy, kept it on a shelf
Did the too proud, too cool to ask for any help
For when I gave in praying I only got one answer back
And he said

I guess you gotta make a choice when it hits the fan
You can get a little down or get a little mad
When there's stones in the road only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rocks in your shoes

It bitters like a weed if you let it grow
It's gonna trip you up, yeah somewhere down the road
To get where you're going there's only one thing to do
You gotta learn to walk with rock's in your shoes
You better learn to walk with rocks in your shoes, come on!

You gotta learn to walk

192,Jamey Johnson,43,In Color,2008,"

[Verse 1]
I said Grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there, he said yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression

[Refrain]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 2]
This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 3]
And this one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the, summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud

[Bridge]
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

Should've seen it in color

193,Eli Young Band,44,When It Rains,2008,"

[Verse 1]
Give me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside

[Chorus]
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, some people get down, they're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

[Verse 2]
I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left 'cause she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise

[Chorus]
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, some people get down, they're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

[Bridge]
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try

Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

[Verse 1]
My friends say they're proud of me
For taking our breakup so casually
But they don't see what lies beneath my smile
It appears that I'm okay
And I moved on when you walked away
But the truth is since you said goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm invisibly shaken and quietly breakin'
Desperately takin' one breath at a time
Beneath this composure I know it's over
Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken

[Verse 2]
If it looks like I don't care
It's not killing me seeing you here
And hearing you say you want to try us again
Believe me it ain't easy being this cool
But too many times girl I've been your fool
And I know I'd just end up here again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby I'm dying cause you can't be mine
But I will never show the toll it's taking
Cause I'm invisibly shaken

[Verse 1]
I'll bet you the wine is fine
And I'll bet you the diamonds are real
And I'll bet you his house is the big one Up on the hill
Hey, that's where he's got me girl
And not that I blame you at all
Now don't say you're sorry
Just go and have you a ball

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred-dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna bait your hook?
Who's gonna get lost in your eyes?
Who's gonna throw that ball
That wins you the prize?
Yeah, who's gonna kiss you good night?
Make it last all night long?
Yeah, who's gonna be there?
When he's always gone?

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred-dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love

[Verse 3]
He can buy you all he wants to
But girl I ain't sold
So keep my number handy
Cause I think we both know

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't got his kind of money
And I probably never will
But I got a buck that says
His twenties and his hundred-dollar bills
Ain't gonna satisfy you forever
They can only buy so much
I ain't got his kind of money
But he ain't got my kind of love

[Outro]
I ain't got his kind of money
But you're gonna miss my kind of love
You're gonna miss me baby, ha!
That's right, my kind of love

196,David Nail,47,I'm About To Come Alive,2008,"

I can hear you downstairs crying on the phone
Telling someone that I'm here but you still feel all alone
Maybe we were too young
Goodbye, I've gotta go
I can hear the baby waking up
Got to get back to the life I know

I should have never believed him
Maybe I should just leave here

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
And I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

No one thought I was good enough for you
Except for you
Don't let them be right
After all that we've been through
'Cause somewhere over that rainbow
There's a place for me
A place with you

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

In every frame upon our wall
Lies a face that's seen it all
Through ups and downs and then more downs
We helped each other off of the ground
No one knows what we've been through
Making it ain't making it without you

Maybe I'm not but you're all I got left to believe in
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive
I know that it's been hard
And it's been a long time coming
Don't give up on me
I'm about to come alive

I'm about to come alive

197,Craig Morgan,48,Love Remembers,2008,"

You can't forget what love was wearing
When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers

Yeah love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

Love remembers
(Love remembers)
(The sound of the pouring rain)
Beatin' down on the top of a car
(On the side of the road)
(Where it couldn't wait)

198,Eddy Arnold,49,To Life,2008,"

If I had my life to live over I'd do the same things again
I'd still want to roam to the place we call home
Where my happiness never would end

I'd meet you when school days were onward
And walk through the lanes that we'd knew
If I had my life to live over I'd still fall in love with you

I'd meet you when school days...

199,Bucky Covington,50,I'll Walk,2008,"

We were 18, it was prom night
We had our first big fight
She said ""Pull this car over""
I did and then I told her, ""I don't know what you are crying for""
I grabbed her hand, as she reached for the door

She said, I'll walk
Let go of my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and you don't understand
So just be quiet
And later we will talk
Just leave, don't worry. I'll walk

It was a dark night, a black dress
Driver never saw her, around the bend
I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital
When they said her legs still wouldn't move
I cried, when I walked into her room

She said, I'll walk
Please come and hold my hand
Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand
Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk
Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk

I held her hand through everything
The weeks and months of therapy
And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride
She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle
So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles

And says, I'll walk
Please hold my hand
I know that this will hurt, I know you understand
Please daddy don't cry
This is already hard
Let's go, don't worry
I'll walk

200,Sugarland,1,It Happens,2009,"

[Verse 1]
Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens

[Verse 2]
My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
""I'll be right back,"" going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
""Sorry 'bout your neck baby""
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it

Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is...Pshh, it happens

201,Brad Paisley,2,Then,2009,"

[Verse 1]
I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 2]
I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 3]
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

202,Keith Urban,3,Kiss A Girl,2009,"

[Intro]
To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 2]
'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Oh I wanna kiss her now

203,Kenny Chesney,4,Out Last Night,2009,"

[Verse 1]
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

[Verse 2]
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

[Bridge]
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night

204,Montgomery Gentry,5,One In Every Crowd,2009,"

Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
That everybody around here's tryin to beat
He's a six pack up when he walks in
Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

He's a hard drinkin man's man
And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

It's usually me, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd, that's right

205,Jason Aldean,6,She's Country,2009,"

[Intro]
You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

[Verse 1]
She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country

[Verse 2]
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country

[Bridge]
(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country

[Outro]
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone
She's country

206,Dierks Bentley,7,Sideways,2009,"

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
But I sure do like your style
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild

[Chorus]
And it's hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways

[Verse 2]
Ain't no need to fight
You all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for
Once you're out you ain't coming back
The man on the ropes ain't got no slack
Man they're busting down the door!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
That's right
Hey now here we go
(hey now here we go)
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to come back for more

[Chorus]
Hey now here we go
D-J don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Going to get a little bit sideways (na na na na na)
Sideways...sideways...sideways

Hey girl what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing

207,Zac Brown Band,8,Whatever It Is,2009,"

[Verse 1]
She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

208,Carrie Underwood Featuring Randy Travis,9,I Told You So,2009,"

[Verse 1: Carrie Underwood]
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

[Verse 3: Randy Travis, Carrie Underwood, Randy & Carrie]
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

[Verse 4: Randy Travis, Carrie Underwood, Randy & Carrie]
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Randy Travis, Randy & Carrie]
Would you say I told you so? Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Now I found somebody new (Now I found somebody new) and you will never break my heart in two again

[Verse 1]
I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems

[Pre-Chorus]
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

[Chorus]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through

[Pre-Chorus]
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

Whoa, whoa
Oh, I run to you

210,Eli Young Band,11,Always The Love Songs,2009,"

[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs
Always the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 1]
Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

[Chorus]
She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe

[Chorus]
She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause

[Chorus]
She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me

212,Jason Michael Carroll,13,Where I'm From,2009,"

On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And ""Amazing Grace"" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace
It's where I'm from
How sweet the sound
It's where I'm from
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, amazing grace

213,Toby Keith,14,Lost You Anyway,2009,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Verse 2]
I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Outro]
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

[Verse 1]
I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex

He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

[Verse 2]
Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

Drop by his place
Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say, yeah I will in time

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

[Chorus]
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Verse 2]
He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

[Chorus]
But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Verse 3]
Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

[Bridge]
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said

[Chorus]
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater

All of this screamin ain't gettin us nowhere tonight
Youre dead set on leavin, both of us tired of the same old fight
Your drawers are empty, your closet too
Your lips are ready to say were through

But how about you dont slam that door
Call it quits, throw your suitcase in that old Ford
Back the car out, make that right, hit the highway
Say goodbye, how about you dont

I wanna be a changed man, yeah, Im gonna do the right thing now
I know I lose my temper, thats when everything goes south
But you do too, you know its true but walking out ain't the thing to do

So how about you dont slam that door
Call it quits, throw your suitcase in that old Ford
Back the car out, make that right, hit the highway, say goodbye
How about you dont

Please dont say that its over

Lets just try one more time, there ain't no good in saying goodbye

Know where I'm goin from here
Hot headed women, cold beer
Kick up my heels for a little while
And do it country style

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Verse 2]
How I keep catching her eye
Man, I keep wondering why
Ain't nothing special 'bout
An ""awe shucks"" country boy
Lord, she's sure lookin' good
Like something from Hollywood
She got me thinkin' that I just might
Leave here with her tonight

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Verse 3]
Cause I am who I am and that's
The man I'm gonna be, yeah
And when the Lord comes callin'
Well, he ain't gonna have
To holler, y'all
There'll be no trouble finding me

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Outro]
With my boots on
He's gonna take me home
Lord, with my boots on

[Verse 1]
Down a back road
Long, hot summer
A couple kids runnin' loose and wild
He kissed her
She said mister
Take an inch and I'll give you a mile
I ain't here to do anything half-way
Don't give a damn what anyone might say
I just wanna free fall for a while

[Chorus]
That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading
To the first sweet taste of freedom
You got me runnin' baby
Wild at heart

[Verse 2]
About midnight, he tells her
I ain't got no come-on lines
Well I'll love you, or I'll try to
We got nothing to lose but time
Stick your hand into my back pocket
Light me up like a bottle rocket
I just wanna free fall for a while

That rebel moon is shinin'
Those stars burn like diamonds
Hell bent on chasin' down that crazy spark
I'll follow you where you're leading

[Verse 1]
I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again

[Chorus]
I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone

[Verse 2]
Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why

[Chorus]
I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone

I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone

[Verse 3]
I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till your gone

Every time you need to take it home?
Seeing you there just breaks my heart?
I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone

Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone

A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
'Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
I wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA

Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six-pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

[Verse 2]
Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA

Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light

Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons

My 4-wheel drive and 8 point bucks
And rocky road ice cream

226,Darryl Worley,27,Sounds Like Life To Me,2009,"

Got a call last night from an old friend's wife
Said I hate to bother you
Johnny Ray fell off the wagon
He's been gone all afternoon
I know my buddy so I drove to Skully's
And found him at the bar
I say hey man, what's going on
He said I don't know where to start

Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the baby's cutting teeth
I didn't get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ain't what you wanna hear
But it's what I'm gonna say

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy
It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride
Get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life

Man I know its tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me
Sounds like life

6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
""Hey Daisy rise and shine""
He pours two bowls full of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
""The bus is here, we love you mom""

He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down

Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, ""I love you dad""
Daddy says it right back
""Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you, and Daisy, and your mom
I'm so proud of you son.""

He's only ten
Just comin' of age he oughta to be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's 6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes

There's been times I've let my faith run thin
Not been the man I should have been
After all the trouble I've been in, I'da gave up on me
I've lived hard and I've lived fast
Lost things I will never get back
Cause someone to look past all of that
God must really love me

When I look at the miracles around me
At the way that I live and the way He forgives
I know He's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I'm still alive is
God must really love me

Wake up and feel you by my side
The perfect girl, the perfect time
And see the way our future shines
God must really love me

When I look at the miracles around me
At the dream that I live and the gift that he gives
I know he's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I get to live this life is God must really love me

When I showed the worst, He saw the best
He pulled the world right off my chest
Every day I wake up I feel blessed
Yeah, I feel so blessed
God must really love me
God must really love me
God must really love me

Come on ladies, it's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on

230,Love And Theft,31,Runaway,2009,"

It's been a long week
I've got a slow leak in my left front tire
I'm sick of where I work
My boss is such a jerk, don't care if I get fired

My back's about to break
No money in the bank
And she don't call me anymore
I'm down to my last drink, it's time to sell my things

And pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my getaway

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight
At the break of day
I'll be a runaway

A hundred miles in, I got a stupid grin
On my scruffy face
With every cigarette I'm burning my regrets
Don't want to leave a trace

And from the rearview, I've got clear view
Of who I used to be
A little bit faster now
Don't wanna turn around

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my getaway

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight
And at the break of day
I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)

It's crazy, I know, to count on this road
To give me what I need
But with every state line
Somehow I find another part of me, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks
And make my get away

I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down
Leave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight
And at the break of day
I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)
(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)

That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby

Keep your faith, keep your faith

Looking forward to it, for some time

Thirty five years later, they're still goin' strong

234,Jamey Johnson,35,High Cost Of Living,2009,"

[Verse 1]
I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure, piled up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd been, hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly

[Verse 2]
And three days straight was no big feat, could get by with no food or sleep
And crazy was becomin' my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm

[Chorus]
My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

[Verse 3]
That southern Baptist parkin' lot, was where I'd go to smoke my pot
An' sit there in my pickup truck and pray
Starin' at that giant cross, just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way

[Verse 4]
As soon as Jesus turned his back, I'd find my way across the tracks
Lookin' just to score, another deal
With my back against that damn eightball
I didn't have to think or talk, or feel

[Chorus]
My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

[Verse 5]
My whole life went through my head, layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land, my sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore

[Verse 6]
With my new found sobriety, I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had, and threw away
This prison is much colder than
That one that I was locked up in just yesterday

[Chorus]
My life is just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

I tell you, the high cost of livin'
It ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

235,Bomshel,36,Fight Like A Girl,2009,"

Little girl alone on the playground
Tired of gettin' teased and gettin' pushed around
Wishin' she was invisible
To them

She ran home cryin'
""Why do they hate me?""
And Mama wiped the tears and said
""Baby, you're brave and you're beautiful
So, hold your head high
Don't ever let 'em define
The light in your eyes
Love yourself, give them Hell
You can take on this world
You just stand and be strong
And then fight
Like a girl.""

At 31 she was wheelin' and dealin'
Kept on hittin' that same glass ceilin'
She was never gonna one of the boys, no
She coulda gave up on her ambition
And spent the rest of her life just wishin'
Instead she listened to her mama's voice sayin'

""Hold your head high
Don't ever let 'em define
The light in your eyes
Love yourself, give them Hell
You can take on this world
You just stand and be strong
And then fight
Like a girl.""

Oh, with style and grace
Kick ass and take names…

Ten years of climbin' that ladder
Oh, but money and power don't matter
When the doctor said ""the cancer spread""
She holds on tight to her husband and babies
And says ""this is just another test God gave me
And I know just how to handle this""

I'll hold my head high
I'll never let this define
The light in my eyes
Love myself, give it Hell
I'll take on this world
If I stand and be strong
No, I'll never give up
I will conquer with love
And I'll fight like
Like a girl!

You're the kind of boy my daddy used to warn
Would walk into my life and lead me down the wrong way
I'm the kind of girl who tried hard to ignore
Those things that daddy warned about those kind of boys
Well, what's a girl to do with a big ol' boy like you?

I'm for dusty pawn shop guitars
And boxers passed their prime
I'm for soakin' up the wisdom
When an old man speaks his mind

I'm for laid off factory workers
When the wolf is at the door
You don't have to guess what I'm against
If you know what I'm for

I'm for Texas Margaritas
Gettin' outta debt
I'm for havin' faith in something
That hasn't happened yet

For the shy kid in the corner
Afraid to ask the girl to dance
For the ex-con outta prison
Who just wants a second chance

For the inner city teacher
With her heart stuck in her throat
Can still see God in every child
And never gives up hope

I'm for dusty pawn shop guitars
And boxers passed their prime
I'm for soakin' up the wisdom
When and old man speaks his mind

I'm for Detroit factory workers
When the wolf is at the door
You don't have to guess what I'm against
If you know what I'm for

I'm counting all my blessings
When the wolf is at my door
You don't have to ask what I'm against
You don't have to guess what I'm against

"
238,Brooks & Dunn,39,Indian Summer,2009,"

The tall weeds lay flat down
On the hard flat Kansas ground
And a sad song in her head
Kept blowin' round

She barely even knew his name
But she liked the way he played the game
Everybody cheered
When he scored that last touchdown...

Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

Tangled in a moment of truth
Bottle of wine in a motel room
Blue haze circled 'round
The cold gray moon

While the wind chased the leaves outside
Passion found a place to hide
Late September heat
Couldn't be denied

Oh Indian Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

She never even finished school
People like to talk, they can be so cruel
Heard California was a place
To start brand new

So she left that dust bowl town
Sometimes when a long wind howls
I wonder where we'd be
If I never scored that last
Touchdown

Summer
The wonder
The hunger
And the sound of distant thunder
Indian Summer

"
239,David Nail,40,Red Light,2009,"

[Verse 1]
So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what ""I don't love you"" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye

[Chorus]
At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

[Verse 2]
I thought she was gonna say
Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said ""it's over"", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

[Chorus]
But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

[Bridge]
There's a mama calming down a little baby
In the backseat in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best
Just waiting on green
But I can't see getting past

[Chorus]
This red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

[Chorus]
At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

[Outro]
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light

You call me up
The conversion goes in the usual way
What cha doin
Whole lot of nothin
Oh its been a long long day
And then you mention
You got this bottle of wine
You been savin for awhile
Yeah its just waitin to be opened
I can almost hear you smile
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
Your auburn hair fallin down your shoulders
Come on baby what are you waitin for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
You been lookin
For that little black dress
You found the perfect one today
Yeah its just hangin in the closet
You wanna wear it in the worst of ways
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
That little strap kinda fallin off your shoulder
Come on baby its what you bought it for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
You say the loneliness has got you down tonight
Your bodys tired and its wound up tight
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Id love to see you standin at my door
Kick off your shoes and let me rub your shoulders
Come on baby what are you waitin for
You got the wine
Ive got all night
Were only gettin older
Since you brought it up
Why dont you bring it over
Why dont you bring it over

241,Miranda Lambert,42,Dead Flowers,2009,"

[Verse 1]
I feel like the
Flowers in this vase
He just brought them
Home one day
""Aren't they beautiful""
He said
They've been here in
The kitchen and the
Water's turning grey
They're sitting in
The vase but now
They're dead
Dead flowers

I feel like this
Long string of lights
They lit up our whole
House on Christmas day
But now it's January
And the bulbs have
All burned out
But still they hang
Like dead flowers

[Chorus]
He isn't feeling anything
My love, my hurt, or the
Sting of this rain
I'm living in a hurricane
All he can say is
""Man isn't it such a nice day""
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 2]
I feel like the
Tires on this car
They said we won’t go far
But we're still rolling
I look in the rear view
And I see dead flowers in the yard
And that string of lights
But and it isn't glowing
Like dead flowers
Like dead flowers

[Chorus]
He isn't feeling anything
My love, my hurt, or the
Sting of this rain
I'm driving through a hurricane
All he can say is
""Man isn't it such a nice day""
Hey, hey I guess we'll just
Go to waste, like dead flowers

[Outro]
Like dead flowers
Dead flowers

242,Bucky Covington,43,I Want My Life Back,2009,"

He was warmin' his hands with a hot coffee cup
And pourin' in whiskey
As I walked up, he never blinked an eye
He just asked for a light

I noticed he didn't have soles on his shoes
So I pulled out a twenty, said go buy some food
But he just stared at his cup like I wasn't there
Then he looked at me, said son that's nice
But there's some things money can't buy

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want that job I worked for 22 years before I got laid off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back

I walked through the door and sat down at the bar
Had a shot and a beer, lit up a cigar
It ran through my head, every word that old man said

I had a woman that loved me with all of her heart
But my pride and my temper made it all fall apart
I was too headstrong to admit when I was wrong
It's been 6 months since she moved out
Guess my pride ain't helping me now

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear her voice and see her face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back

I paid my tab and left that bar
I grabbed my phone, jumped in my car
I dialed her number and when she said hello, I said

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear your voice and see your face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and the man I used to be
I want my life back, I want my life back

243,Trace Adkins,44,All I Ask For Anymore,2009,"

[Verse 1]
It was a home run when the game was tied
A pick up truck when I could drive
One pink line when Katie said I'm late
It was a passing grade, a pretty girl
All the money in the world
What mattered then kept changing every day

[Chorus]
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more

[Verse 2]
Nowadays it's crazy how
A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home

[Chorus]
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more

[Bridge]
Let them outlive me by a hundred years
Let their laughter dry up all their tears
Let them love and be loved back like I have been

[Chorus]
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please Lord
That's all I ask for any more

[Outro]
That's all that matters anymore

244,Luke Bryan,45,Do I,2009,"

[Verse 1]
Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

[Verse 2]
Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

[Verse 3]
Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?

245,Lee Ann Womack,46,Solitary Thinkin',2009,"

Well I only came into this bar
To hear a sad song
But I'll probably be here all night long
The way I'm feeling now
I couldn't get you on the phone
So, I let it ring
On and on in a lonesome serenade

Oooh, what am I gonna do about my problems now
Maybe I should try to find a way
To kinda, sorta, maybe, work it out, ooh

With some solitary thinkin'
And lonesome drinkin'
Oooh, it sure does make a body feel at home
And a double barrel whiskey
And oh baby, tell me do you miss me
Some solitary thinkin' and lonesome drinkin' for me tonight

There's two things that'll kill a girl
They'll strike her down right where she stands
One is his voice and one is the rock glass sitting in my hand

Oooh, lights are gettin' dimmer now
That means they gonna shut me down
And it's just like crystal
It ain't always really clear

Tell me baby now
How am I gonna get myself to sleep now that you're gone
Maybe I should try to find a way to kinda think about carrying on
On my own

With some solitary thinkin'
And lonesome drinkin'
Oooh, it sure does make a body feel at home
And a double barrel whiskey
And oh baby, tell me do you miss me
Some solitary thinkin' and lonesome drinkin' for me tonight

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said ""Y'all get in""

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust off the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

Well I sure am tired of these coffee house gigs
Cause there ain't no money and there ain't no chicks

Cause I wanna see my name up in neon lights drink pink champagne and party every night
All them lucky muthers up there livin the life man I gotta get my ass to Nashville

Man I wanna be a country star

Well I got a drinkin problem so I'll fit right in
Gonna sing me some hits and get some famous friends
I'll be ridin shotgun with Kenny, Faith, and Tim
And I wonder how they lived without me

With a big ol' fence to keep the rif raf out
Call my old girlfriends say ""how ya like me now""
C'mon baby tell me what ya love about me

Verse 1:
He's got an I love Jesus fish stuck on his bumper
With a rebel flag rippin' like a razor in the wind
A sign sellin' watermelons and cucumbers
And common advice you might need now and then

Bridge:
Ya, He parks there off the pavement just slightly in a ditch
He's got a two-tone tattered lawn chair where he smokes his pipe and sits
And when the sun goes down the price goes down, and everybody knows
There ain't one second that'll tick past seven that he ain't headed home

Chorus:
But you can come back early in the morning
Get what you need fresh from the garden
A little less ripe if that's how you like it
If you ain't tried it you better not knock it
If you didn't go to church the Sunday before
You can hear all about it and a little bit more
About what it takes to make a man a man
Down at Henry Cartwright's back home, home grown, prayer and produce stand

Verse 2:
His daddy passed down the ground to raise it
The know how and the plow he used to make it
And when you sink your teeth in it's a sin to taste it
And if you had to stand in line it's worth the wait!

Bridge:
Ya, He parks there off the pavement just slightly in a ditch
He's got a two-tone tattered lawn chair where he smokes his pipe and sits
And when the sun goes down the price goes down, and everybody knows

If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'

I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man

To the man I wanna be

If there's any way for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cause it's going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see

[Verse 4]
That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be

252,Kenny Chesney,3,Ain't Back Yet,2010,"

[Verse 1]
I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I am not back yet

69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever

[Verse 2]
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I am not back yet
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here

[Verse 3]
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I am not back yet

I was gone, gone and I am not back yet
I was gone and I am not back
I am not back, am not back yet

I know they say ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Bridge]
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else

If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 1]
So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall
Yeah, you've had a pocketfull of regrets
Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all
When the cold, hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it

[Chorus]
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Love, it can weather any storm
Bring you back to being born, again
Oh, it's the helping hand
When you needed it most
The lightouse shining on the coast
That never goes dim
When your heart is full of doubt
As you think that there's no way out

[Chorus]
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable
It's unstoppable

[Bridge]
Like a river keeps on rollin'
Like a north wind blowin'
Don't it feel good knowin'
Yeah--

[Chorus]
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

[Outro]
Love is unstoppable
So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
But love, love is unstoppable

Roll into town, step off the bus
Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar, walk down the street
Sign says ""Nashville, Tennessee""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I have found

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town

[Verse 2]
You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town

[Bridge]
One year they repossess your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town

[Verse 1]
Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water

[Chorus]
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 2]
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh let her go boys

[Chorus]
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 3]
You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water

261,Clay Walker,12,She Won't Be Lonely Long,2010,"

Something 'bout the way she’s wearing her dress a little tighter
Something 'bout the way she’s starin', she’s lookin' to start a fire
Something 'bout the way she’s dancin' and drinkin' chill Patron
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long

[Chorus]
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

Something 'bout the way she’s blushin' you can tell she isn’t sure
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long

[Chorus]
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

If I had a woman like that
Man I’d let her know
I’d hold her tight
I’d hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She’d never ever be alone

[Chorus]
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, Lord if she’s lonely now
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle

Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town

Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

269,Jaron And The Long Road To Love,20,Pray For You,2010,"

I haven't been to church since I don't remember when
Things were going great til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do
He said you can't go hatin' others who have done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry but we must not condemn
Let the good Lord do his job, you just pray for them

I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, honey, I pray for you

I'm really glad I found my way to church
Cause I'm already feelin' better and I thank God for the words
Yeah, I'm gonna take the high road and do what the preacher told me to do
You keep messin' up, and I'll keep prayin' for you

I pray your tire goes out at 110
I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend
And wake up with his and her tattoos

I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, near or far
In your house or in your car
Wherever you are, honey, I pray for you
I pray for you

They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?

Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Verse]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

[Chorus]
[You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night]
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

"
276,Craig Morgan,27,This Ain't Nothin',2010,"

He was standin' in the rubble
Of an old farmhouse outside Birmingham
When some on-the-scene reporter
Stuck a camera in the face of that old man

He said, ""Tell the folks, please mister, what are you gonna do
Now that this twister has taken all that's dear to you""
The old man just smiled and said, ""Boy, let me tell you somethin'
This ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam""

""And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
And I held her hand 'til her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I learned at an early age
There's things that matter, and there's things that don't
So if you're waitin' here for me to cry
I hate to disappoint you boy, but I won't""

Then he reached down in the rubble and picked up a photograph
Wiped the dirt off of it with the hand that he still had
He put it to his lips and he said, ""Man she was somethin'
But, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam""

""And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
We were holdin' hands when her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""This ain't nothin' time won't erase
And this ain't nothin' money can't replace""

He said, ""You sit and watch your lovin' wife
Of fifty years fightin' for her life
Then you hold her hand 'til her heart of gold stops pumpin'
Yeah, boy that's somethin'""

""So, this ain't nothin'
No, this ain't nothin'""

277,Gary Allan,28,Get Off On The Pain,2010,"

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heartbroke country song
I ain't really happy
Until the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain

My whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars and shoulda-run-aways
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain

[Chorus]
'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

[Verse 2]
I wake up every morning
A thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy
To find a better way
Oh, but I know I'll never change

[Chorus]
'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road
Just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

'Cause I love the long shots
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack
With the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

"
278,Keith Urban,29,I'm In,2010,"

[Verse 1]
Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tongue-tied

[Chorus]
If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in

[Verse 2]
Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way

[Chorus]
If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in

[Bridge:]
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am

[Chorus]
If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet's silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in

[Outro]
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here baby come here baby come here

279,Josh Turner,30,All Over Me,2010,"

[Verse 1]
Well the weather man says it's going to be a hot one, heard it on the radio
Load up the boat, grab your girl if you got one, nice little breeze going to blow
Baby I'm on my way to come and get you, meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini and your Coppertone 45

[Chorus]
Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me
All over me

[Verse 2]
We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight, let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river, get a little carried away
Well I can take a side kiss on your sweet lips, ain't going to want it to end
So when the morning comes, we'll roll on out, and do it all over again

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Outro]
Pour it all over me
All over me

280,David Nail,31,Turning Home,2010,"

[Verse 1]
Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

[Chorus]
I don't know no town like the old town
Even when the miles are many, I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there somethin' 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turnin' home

[Verse 2]
I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget

[Chorus]
And I don't know no friends like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now like I did with them
But deep inside me a piece of history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
And it keeps me turnin' home

[Verse 3]
Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

[Chorus]
And I don't know no love like the first love
When I think about the best times she's the one I think of
Deep inside me all though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah

281,Josh Thompson,32,Way Out Here,2010,"

(Verse 1)
Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son
Our necks are burnt, the roads are dirt and our trucks ain't clean
The dogs run loose, we smoke, we chew and fry everything
Out Here, Way out here

(Chorus)
We won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here

(Verse 2)
We've got a fighting side a mile wide but we pray for peace
Cause it's mostly us that end up serving over seas
Hell if it was up to me I'd love to see this Country run
Like it used to be, like it ought to be and just like it's done
Out here, way out here

(Chorus)
Cause we won't take a dime if we ain't earned it
When it comes to weight, brother we pull our own
If it's all backwoods where you live and you're concerned with
Well you can leave us alone
Just worry about John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere
Way out here

Our houses are protected by the good Lord and a gun
And you might meet 'em both if you show up here not welcome son

282,Bucky Covington,33,A Father's Love (The Only Way He Knew How),2010,"

For the longest time, I guess I thought
He didn't give a damn
Hard to read, hard to please
Yeah, that was my old man

On the day I left for college
It was nothing new
We never had that heart-to-heart
He had too much to do

He checked the air in my tires
The belts and all the spark plug wires
Said, ""When the hell's the last time
You had this oil changed?""

And as I pulled out the drive
He said, ""Be sure and call your mom sometime""
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, ""I love you""
The only way he knew how

120,000 miles
Six years down the road
A brand new life and a brand new wife
We'd just bought our first home

When he finally came to visit
I thought he'd be so proud
He never said he liked the place
He just got his tool belt out

And put new locks on the doors
Went back and forth to the hardware store
Said, ""Come and hold this flashlight""
As he crawled beneath the sink

And these old wires ain't up to code
And that circuit box is gonna overload
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, ""I love you""
The only way he knew how

Last Sunday, we all gathered
For his 65th birthday
And I knew he'd stiffen up
But I hugged him anyway

When it was finally time to say goodbye
I knew what was next
Just like he always does
Right before we left

He checked the air in my tires
The belts and all the spark plug wires
Said, ""When the hell's the last time
You had this oil changed?""

And as I pulled out the drive
He said, ""Be sure and call your mom sometime""
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying, ""I love you""
He was saying, ""I love you""
The only way he knew how

283,Laura Bell Bundy,34,Giddy On Up,2010,"

Woo hoo!

Baby where you been? It's half past ten
Oh, look you're late again
Busy day, got a lot on your mind?
You should hear about mine

A tall drink of water and a pretty little thing
Were kissing on the corner in the pouring rain
Turned my head to get a better view
Oh Lord help me, it was you

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

Oh I ain't finished
Sit back down

Been acting pretty strange, didn't want to talk
Mmm, there's a pep in your walk
Smiling a lot when you look at your phone
There's a change in your tone

I've been through your pockets and smelled your shirts
I don't wear Bath and Body Works
Should've seen the signs you were sneakin' around
She must be the number on the napkin I found

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

Oh let me tell you
I guess you could say that I was blind
I was blinded by my love
I did everything for you
And now push has come to shove

So let's call the spade a spade
Was it worth the price you paid?
Now I am done, I'm a lucky one
And you can sleep in the bed you've made

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

Love, love you let me down
You're making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
No, you won't string me along

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving

Love, love you let me down, let me down
You won't string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up and giddy on out

284,Rodney Atkins,35,Farmer's Daughter,2010,"

Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin' to work
Till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said I'm your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin round

I was haulin hay, I was feedin the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
Then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin' out loud, thinkin bout quitin'
Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
Cuz just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter
We got married last spring
Woah and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
I'm on the tractor and shes on my mind
And I can't wait till its quitin' time
And just when I think it can't get no hotter
I come home to the farmer's daughter
Yeah the farmer's daughter

[Verse 1]
Lace-up boots and faded jeans
A homemade sandwich, a half jug of tea
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol' end and same ol' day

[Chorus]
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man

[Verse 2]
All week long making a living
Life keeps takin', he keeps giving
Behind the scene, below the grade
Hardly noticed but part of everything

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He gives his life then fades away
Another young man takes his place
Average Joe, average pay
Same ol end, same old' day

[Chorus]
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
No, there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
Kind of glue that sticks this world together
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land
God bless the working man

The working man
Oh, the working man and woman

Let's blow out these city lights
Let's just leave it all behind
Get up where the air is still
You can hear the whippoorwill
Start a fire, pass the 'shine
Won't be home 'til morning time
Shout your name out in the wind
Confess my love for you again
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

[Verse 2]
Hey, now, honey child
We'd be running free and wild
No one care what you do
Ain't no law to answer to
Dance around in the dirt
Listen to them crickets chirp
Hear old Jake start to howl
When he hears that old hoot owl
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

[Verse 3]
Come on, girl, it's almost dawn
Let's get it 'fore the magic's gone
Tall, tall grass all around
Come on lay that blanket down
Wild flowers just like you
Lay on me like morning dew
Now take my hand walk with me
Sun come up through them trees
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

And the sun starts sinkin' slower
Weekends go by faster and beer starts tastin colder
Wanna tune into a station takes me on a soul vacation
Hey there mister DJ come on wont you please play
One that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down
Crank it up real loud
Groovy little summer song
Yeah
Make me feel the rhythm of one tropical islands
Take me to a beach somewhere everyone is smilin'
Sippin' margaritas and eyein' senoritas
I can almost see 'em swayin' once ya start playin'
One that we can dance to
Start a big romance to
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along
While cruisin' with the top down

Groovy little summer song

I got my old guitar and some fishing poles
So baby fill that cooler full of something cold
Don't ask, just pack and we'll hit the road runnin
Honey what do you say?
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away

[Chorus]
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby let's roll with it

[Verse 2]
We get so caught up in catchin' up
Trying to pay the rent, tryna to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that?
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you kick back baby and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock

[Chorus]
And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby let's roll with it
Baby let's roll with
Baby we'll roll with it
Baby we'll roll with it

All the stars keep on falling around us
We were almost broken
Holding on as we felt our worlds collide, collide
Sometimes all the answers, baby, are right outside your door
Sometimes all we need is a little time, time

[Chorus]
There’s no going back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right
The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight

[Verse 2]
Turn the pages, we’ll write another chapter
Be the last one standing
Burn those bridges down and we’ll never go back, no
We don’t need all the answers baby
We’ve just gotta try
I refuse to walk away this time, this time

There’s no going back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right
The world is ours tonight
The only thing I have is everything to lose
I would lay it on the line for you
To be here by my side
The world is ours tonight

We can't take it back to the start again
Time will tell us how the story ends
So beautiful, we can make it right

290,Randy Montana,41,Ain't Much Left Of Lovin' You,2010,"

There's an evening dress in the closet with a red wine stain on the sleeve
Your pillow's still on the bed where we used to sleep
And in the dresser drawer there's a couple more things that smell like your perfume
But other than that there ain't much left of lovin' you

And all I got left is a big broken heart and memories I can't drink away
Just because the man I was wasn't enough to make you stay
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

The flowers that you planted on either side of the steps out front
Before they bloom I think I might dig 'em up
And that old porch swing, those songs you sing, and the cold and bitter truth
But other than that there ain't much left of lovin' you

And all I got left is a big broken heart and memories I can't drink away
And just because the man I was wasn't enough to make you stay
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left
The heaven we had, the hell that I'm going through
Other than that, there ain't much left of lovin' you

Yeah, there ain't much left, there ain't much left of lovin' you

Your dark hair draped across my pillow
Says I finally got it right
And as I watch you dreaming, twisted in the sheets
I can't stop thinking about last night

Well I've waited so long, so long, so long
For someone like you
And as this morning breaks through the window pane
It reveals the truth

Baby, you're my sunshine, first light
Find your way to places that only know lies
Failed tries and bruised skies
With hardly time to hold on or be strong, now I'm strong
'Cos like the dawn you push it all away

I tell ya, you're my sunshine
Everybody needs a little sunshine

Your fingertips, a kiss to this tired face
It's like I'm young again
Well I feel beautiful
But most of all vulnerable since you broke in

Baby, you're my sunshine, first light
Find your way to places that only know lies
Failed tries and bruised skies
With hardly time to hold on or be strong. now I'm strong
'Cos like the dawn you push it all away

I tell ya, you're my sunshine
Everybody needs a little sunshine

So won't you take me, take me, take me
Anywhere and everywhere you go
All the warmth you bring to this cold heart
With the slightest touch is enough to know

Baby, you're my sunshine
Everybody needs a little sunshine
Yeah, you're my sunshine
'Cos like the dawn you push it all away

She said she loved me all night long
I couldn't help but let her string my heart along
I knew better, I still do, but I'm not the first man
Who's ever played the fool

[Chorus]
So tell me, why do I keep holding on?
Oh, why do I keep staring down the barrel of a loaded gun?
Tell me, why can't I just let go?
Somebody knows, then tell me

[Verse 2]
I won't point the finger but I'll take the blame
Because I saw her coming from a million miles away
I should've fought the feeling but I gave in
Because those lying blue eyes kept on pulling me back in

Oh, why can't you just tell me if you know?

Uptight-er than an a-string about to break
Tail-draggin', a little ragged
Hangin' by a thread that's startin' to fray

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just in case there might be little ears around
I won't say it, I'll just spell it out

Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

[Verse 2]
Hung-over, a lot closer
To ringin' death's door than I was yesterday
Head-achin', hand-shakin'
Badly in need of a shower and shave

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, I know I'm lookin'
A little rough
The least I can do
Is clean my language up

[Chorus]
I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

[Bridge]
I think I partied
A little too hard last night
Let's see here now
How do I put this right?

[Chorus]
I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

[Outro]
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Percentage sign, at symbol, back-slash, squiggle-thing
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

294,Eli Young Band,45,Guinevere,2010,"

[Verse 1]
She's got a bumper like a billboard
Covered in stickers of her favorite band
She's got a handful of records that she turns to
When she needs to land
She's a Saturday night parade through the streets
That all eyes come to see including me
She carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets
She should have let some go by now but can't seem to drop it
Says forgiveness ain't nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul
That never rolls

[Chorus]
For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

[Verse 2]
She don't hold onto nothin' new for very long
Yeah, she writes you in as just one more tale and then you're gone
'Cause she once fell hard 'cause she dropped her guard
And no one gets to stay, it's just too late

[Chorus]
For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

[Bridge]
For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here

[Chorus]
For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

[Outro]
Oh, lean into me Guinevere
Be mine tonight Guinevere

295,Emily West Featuring Keith Urban,46,Blue Sky,2010,"

So your conscience finally hit you
And you're feeling guilty
And you're wishing I was there
So you wanna say you're sorry
Well, please forgive me if I'm too gone to care
You can take back your goodbyes
Wipe off those sad eyes
Cause I've got some tears of my own

Weather man says it's gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods and you lose the lights
Should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore

So you heard the pitter-patter of a lost heart beating
And learned what it was for
So you made a list of shoulders that you'd be needing
Well mine aren't yours anymore
Come on show me your temper
Be the man I remember
So I won't forget what you've done

Weather man says it's gonna rain tonight
The kind of storm where the basement floods and you lose the lights
Should have thought of that before
Cause I'm not your blue sky anymore

Don't wanna be that blue sky
I'm not your blue sky anymore

296,Kellie Pickler,47,Makin' Me Fall In Love Again,2010,"

[Verse 1]
People will tell you that this kind of love will fade
That being in love like this is only a phase
But baby, after all this time, ain't nothin' changed
All you gotta do is look at me that way

[Pre-Chorus]
And there you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again

Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

[Verse 2]
Baby, sometimes you can say the craziest things
I love how you don't care what nobody thinks
You're highly original, totally in-typical, never change
All I gotta do is look at your smiling face

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again

[Chorus]
Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

[Bridge]
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
Sure feels good to know you feel the same

[Chorus]
I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
Only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

[Post-Chorus]
There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go, there you go makin' me fall in love again

[Outro]
Makin' me fall in love again

Makin' me fall in love again

297,Blaine Larsen,48,Chillin',2010,"

I ain't going to work, ain't going to class
Going bare feet and kickin' back
Gonna pacify my lazy bones ambition
Chillin'

I'm talkin', jet skis and inner tubes
Pretty girls with big ol' blue eyes
And wet t-shirts on the river

Just chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'

Good ol' boys sitting on a rock
Passing a jar and an old flat top singin'
Seeger, Cash, Bo Diddley and Bob Dylan
Just a chillin'

Moon comes up and the sun goes down
Under Candy Fort Bridge they're hangin' out
Bunch of happy-go-luckies, skinny dippin'

Yeah, we're chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'

Yeah, we're chillin'
We're beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Just chillin'

Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soakin' up every single minute

Got my thinkin' cap hangin' on a scarecrow
Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time

299,Montgomery Gentry,50,While You're Still Young,2010,"

Blowin' out spring break
With your not right friends
Wake up on the beach
With new ink on your skin

Do something crazy and dumb
While you're still young

Go on and tie the knot
Start a new life
Take turns gettin' up
When the baby cries

Living on nothin' but love
While you're still young

Life is too short
To put it off anymore
You've gotta live it before
It's too late

I can't turn that clock back around
On what you're dreamin' about
You better do it now
Don't wait

Give 'em your two-weeks
At the dead-end job
Do what you love
Be your own boss

Do what they say can't be done
While you're still young

Life is too short
To put it off anymore
You've gotta live it before
It's too late

I can't turn that clock back around
On what you're dreamin' about
You better do it now
Don't wait, don't wait

Take a gold watch
Sell everything
Throw a dart at the map
Hook up the air stream

Ride into that setting sun
Do something crazy and dumb
While you're still young
While we're still young

You're still young

300,Miranda Lambert,1,Heart Like Mine,2011,"

[Verse 1]
I am not the kind you take home to mama
I am not the kind to wear no ring
Somehow I always get stronger
When I'm on my second drink

Even though I hate to admit it
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
The Christian folks say I should quit it
And I just smile and say ""God Bless""

[Chorus]
Because I heard Jesus He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine

[Verse 2]
Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
But said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'll fly away from it all one day
And I'll fly away
These are the days that I will remember
When my names called on a roll
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
And make a toast to me coming home

[Chorus]

And I bet He'd understand
Understand a heart like mine
Oh yes He would

301,Brad Paisley Featuring Alabama,2,Old Alabama,2011,"

[Verse 1]
She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night

[Chorus]
Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!

[Verse 2]
And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band

[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And It’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!

[Verse 3]
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
And Barry White is not going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start

[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree

Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee

[Outro]
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play me some old Alabama
Play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play-ee-ay-ay
Yeee-haw!!!

302,Sara Evans,3,A Little Bit Stronger,2011,"

[Intro]
Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

[Verse 1]
Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Verse 2]
It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Bridge]
Getting along without you baby
I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Outro]
And just a little bit stronger
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit stronger
Get a little bit stronger

303,Rascal Flatts,4,I Won't Let Go,2011,"

[Verse 1]
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone

[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

[Verse 2]
It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains

[Chorus]
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall

Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're gonna make it
Yeah, I know you can make it

'Cause I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh, I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go

Won't let you go
No I won't

304,Keith Urban,5,Without You,2011,"

[Verse 1]
I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet

It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea

[Verse 2]
Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure

How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea

[Verse 3]
Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you

305,Taylor Swift,6,Mean,2011,"

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 1]
Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me
Been going like nothing can wait
I got to get my priorities straight

[Chorus]
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

[Verse 2]
Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Ms. Wonderful, I haven't met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call

[Chorus]
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

[Verse 3]
Step back, smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine

[Chorus]
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Take the girl, get a map and pick any old dot
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot

307,The Band Perry,8,You Lie,2011,"

[Verse 1]
It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow, but baby, I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well, you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie

[Chorus]
You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

[Verse 2]
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby, I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie

[Chorus]
You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

[Bridge]
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry, well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

[Chorus]
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well, it's what you do, it's who you are

Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine

Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said ""I love you""
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey

309,Justin Moore,10,If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away,2011,"

[Verse 1]
Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

[Verse 2]
I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far

If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away

310,Chris Young,11,Tomorrow,2011,"

[Verse 1]
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that we're no good

[Chorus]
But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up
When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop
No matter how bad I want to

[Chorus]
But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow

[Bridge]
Baby, when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save

[Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

[Outro]
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
Yeah, I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would

"
311,Ronnie Dunn,12,Bleed Red,2011,"

[Verse 1]
Let’s say we’re sorry, ’fore it’s too late
Give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water
Let it slip through our hands

[Chorus]
We all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Verse 2]
If we’re fighting, we’re both losing
We’re just wasting our time
Because my scars, they are your scars
And your world is mine

[Chorus]
You and I, we all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red

[Bridge]
Let’s say we’re sorry
’Fore it’s too late

[Chorus]
We all bleed red, all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red

312,Toby Keith,13,Somewhere Else,2011,"

[Verse 1]
I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label
Closed this place down once again
Sitting here wishing you would walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I have to got to go home but I cannot stay here
It is a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you are walking back alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you

[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else

[Verse 2]
Kicking off my shoes, tumbling through the front door
Knowing too well the kind of night I am in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom is cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I will kill the light
And I will lay there wishing you were sleeping at my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you

[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you

[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else

[Outro]
Ah, somewhere else
You might end up somewhere else
Somewhere else
Hey

[Intro]
Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

[Verse 1]
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn

[Bridge]
Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yea
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on

I can love you in the mornin'
I can love you all day
I can love you even more when I get home
I can love you every second
To the ends of the earth
Where needing you's the only thing that's on
My broken one track mind

[Chorus]
Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

[Verse 2]
I could write a thousand letters
Call a hundred times a day
Or try to drown my sorrow at the bar
I could go down to the church
Get on my knees and pray
But it still won't change the way things really are
Won't bring you back again

[Chorus]
Girl, I love you crazy
It comes so easy, after all we had
I could love you with all my heart
But the hardest part is
I just can't love you back

I can love you for all I'm worth
To the ends of the earth
But I just can't love you back

Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man willy said I like to really
But idol's on tv
And ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Verse 2]
Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
""What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?""

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

316,Jason Aldean,17,Dirt Road Anthem,2011,"

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right

I ain't complaining
But I'm tired, so I'm just saying
What I think
And if we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink
My baby's growing up
She think's she's falling all in love
And that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her

Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we going to do ?

Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need

We use to be the one's breaking the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

She rolls her eye's when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom

Swears they won't go far

318,Ashton Shepherd,19,Look It Up,2011,"

The word is faithful, look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout forever, just look it up
It means through thick and thin and
Pitchin' in even when the times get tough

The word is easy, look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try liar, just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
Cause you never thought I'd do this

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

You said you're sober, look it up

It's right next to hell is freezin' over, flyin' pigs
And all that stuff
And how bout baby, look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

The word's forgiveness, look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?

I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up

Asshole

Just look it up, look it up

I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Outro]
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy

[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy

[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy

Come on home, boy

I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishing
I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, living

[Chorus]
And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She hasn’t even thinking about
What’s really going on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’

[Verse 2]
She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is ticking
(Yeah it is)

And she thinks we’re just fishing on the riverside
Throwing back what we could fry
Drowning worms and killing time

And she thinks we’re just fishing
She hasn’t even thinking about

It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back

I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this

I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back

Minimum wage, but it pays the bills
Cleaning floors and leading hymns on Sunday

Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee every day

[Chorus]
She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me

She talks about the clothes
On the line in summer air
Christmas morning
And Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family
That I never had
Well sometimes I find myself
Wishing I'd been there

There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis, '71
Until she can see his face again

A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive

When the lonely set in, I fought back the tears
I don't love you anymore is so hard to hear
It felt like a mile from our door to my truck
Somehow I found the strength to fire it up

How lucky am I you said goodbye
At seven o'clock on a Friday night

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

Well, I usually ain't much on dancin', but tonight I'm cuttin' up a rug
I get to say no ma'am when the ladies ask if I'm with anyone
When I'm tippin' the band and buyin' everybody shots
Spendin' every dollar I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

There ain't an empty space in this parkin' lot
Look at all the friends I got

I won't be lonely long
By the time that first beer is gone
I'll be floatin' on a neon cloud with my friends around
We'll be raising up our glasses and singing out loud

To those done me wrong, drinkin' songs
Hey ladies, tonight it's on
No, I won't be lonely long

[Verse 1]
Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We’re gonna do what lovers do
We’re gonna have a fight or two
But I ain’t ever changin’ my mind

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

[Verse 2]
Wouldn’t last a single day
I’d probably just fade away
Without you, I’d lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin’ life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl
Like crazy, girl

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like
Crazy, girl, don’t you know that I love you?
I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

329,Billy Currington,30,Love Done Gone,2011,"

[Verse 1]
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change
Nothing we can do about it now, no way
This doesn't come easy, but that's just life
We can't keep pretending everything's alright
We told each other it was love before
The simple truth is it just ain't no more
The bells stop ringing, the music won't play
The crazy little feeling that's faded away
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
I don't know where the good times end when

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

[Verse 2]
I don't regret a single thing that we did
Anytime together, we ever spent
I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know
Sometimes we got to just go with the flow
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like money in a slot machine
Don't know what happened to you and me

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt like hell
This is gonna damn near kill me, sometimes the truth ain't easy
I know that you're scared of telling me something
I don't wanna hear, but baby believe that
I'm not leaving, you couldn't give me one good reason

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere
Love's too tough it won't give up no not on us
Baby Love don't run

Let's lay it on the line, I don't care if it takes all night cuz
This is gonna makes us stronger, it's gonna make forever longer
I know it'd be easier walking away but what we got is real
And I wanna save us, baby we can do it, Baby we'll get through it cause

Love don't run, love don't hide
It won't turn away or back down from a fight
Baby I'm right here and I ain't going anywhere

331,Rodney Atkins,32,Take A Back Road,2011,"

Sit in that six-lane backed up traffic
Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair

Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
(Some old back road) to the shady spot where things get hot
(Some old back road) way down, way down
Way down some old back road

332,Kenny Chesney Featuring Grace Potter,33,You And Tequila,2011,"

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

[Chorus]
Because you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Verse 2]
Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Verse 3]
When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Never enough

333,Brantley Gilbert,34,Country Must Be Country Wide,2011,"

[Verse 1]
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Verse 2]
It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know, is gunna change everything
Living with the shame
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around

When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feels the last thing on your mind

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me, let it rain
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain

I found a picture of my mother in her bell-bottom jeans
Flowers in her hair
And two fingers up for peace

In that Polaroid she smiles
A grown up baby boomer
Maybe momma walked down the wild side
Walking on the moon
And what will they say about us?

I've heard stories about my grandpa
Child of the great depression
How growing up broke creates a deep and dark impression

He sits in a rocker down at the Veterans' home
Even when I go to visit
He's still rocking all alone
And what will they say about us?

[Chorus:]
They'll call us generation lost
Or generation greed
Or the connected generation to a plasma screen

Or a generation why
Enough is not enough
Or maybe they'll call us generation love
Generation love

We are children of divorce
And victims of dysfunction
We spell check of course
And GPS the proper junction
We've gotten pretty good at shifting all the blame
But I think I hear an old song
Calling my new name

[Bridge:]
When they open up our time capsule
A hundred years from now

Maybe they will look inside
And see we figured out
How to live with less
And give ourselves away

Just maybe, they'll call us
Just maybe, they'll call us
Generation love (yeah, yeah, yeah)

We are a brand new generation of love
We are a brand new generation of love (oh)

347,Sunny Sweeney,48,Staying's Worse Than Leaving,2011,"

Leavin's hard... trust me, it's really bad
It'll shake ya, damn near break ya, it always has
You don't go until you're prayin' to break even
Until stayin's worse than leavin'

God knows we tried everything that we could do
You can keep your pride and blame me if you need to
Even though this freedom feels a lot like treason
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

It's gotta get better, it can't get worse
Hope it's a blessing not a curse
I don't care who passes judgement on my reasons
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

It's gotta get better, it can't get worse
Hope it's a blessing not a curse
I don't care who passes judgement on my reasons
I know stayin's worse than leavin'

Both our hearts let go a long time ago
Words leave scars and Lord knows they heal slow
Our love died, but somehow we are both still breathin'
I just hope someday we'll look back on this grievin'
And say stayin's worse than leavin'
Yeah, that stayin's worse than leavin'
Yeah, that stayin's worse than leavin'

348,Kip Moore,49,Mary Was The Marrying Kind,2011,"

Yeah, Jenny was the kind you'd call up late
For a date on Friday night
Didn't never matter how much I had to drink
She come and give me a ride

Yeah, Becky was a hell-raising, dart-throwing girl
That could match me beer for beer
Ally was a singer with stars in her eyes
And Mary was the marrying kind

Gretchen was a grad student working on her masters
A little too smart for me
Tammy was a teacher, her daddy was a preacher
Evil as a girl could be

Yeah, Megan was a millionaire, senator's daughter
My collar was too damn blue
Miss Virginia sure was fine
But Mary was the marrying kind

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Mary was a blond-haired, blue-eyed girl next door
With an angel face
I figured I could find her wild side
So I took her on a couple of dates

She was sweet and smart, a queen-size heart
Nothing like the other girls
She just laughed at my best line
Cause Mary was the marrying kind

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Cause she was something different
I didn't know what I was missing
My best friend proved what I already knew
Mary was the marrying kind, yeah

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

Oh Mary, Mary
Couldn't see it at the time
Oh Mary, Mary
How could I've been so blind?

How could I've been so blind?
How could I've been so blind?
Oh, I didn't see it
Babe, I didn't see it
How could I've been so blind?

349,Corey Smith,50,Twenty-One,2011,"

When I was only seventeen, couldn't wait for twenty one
I'd hang around on Clayton Street in the bars there gettin' drunk
A baseball cap and a fake ID would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
I'd say ""I'm pre-Med. here at UGA, live on Milledge Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead, I drive a BMW.""

I was breakin' hearts and takin' names and numbers just for fun
Stealin' kisses wishin' I was twenty one

When Thursdays came and pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern, we'd pay a nickel for every beer
Shootin' pool, smokin' cigarettes with a dizzy head and a grin
Four A.M. on a school night, still hangin' out with my friends
One hour's sleep on a dirty couch, no shower, off to school
Smellin' just like a brewery with a bad hangover too

The teachers all would hassle me: ""Stay awake, pay attention""
I was catchin' hell, wishin' I was twenty one

The youngest one of all my friends, I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecoming parades

Now I look back and I have to smile, cause boy it was fun
Bein' seventeen, wishin' I was twenty one

Now I'm only twenty six, feelin' more like fourty three
My hairline's disappearing, and I never get ID'd
My clothes are out of fashion, no I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o'clock each night, and up at half-past four
Still I go down to that college town when the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can til the whole damn thing is gone

Then I look at all those college girls so innocent and young
And I just check 'em out, and say ""Damn... I wish I was twenty one""

350,Jason Aldean,1,Fly Over States,2012,"

[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

[Verse 5]
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky

You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 6]
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride

Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

[Verse 1]
Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Bridge]
Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid

[Verse 2]
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Break]
It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

352,Kip Moore,3,Somethin' 'Bout A Truck,2012,"

[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

[Verse 2]
And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

[Verse 5]
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

353,Zac Brown Band,4,No Hurry,2012,"

[Verse 1]
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Bridge]
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Going to get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today

With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?

He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes

355,Eric Church,6,Springsteen,2012,"

[Verse1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see

But I’m better than I used to be

When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo

[Verse 2: Gary]
It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone
And the GPS
Those satellites
Ain’t found it yet
Got our own little
Piece of heaven hidden

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out

Yeah you’re gettin’ close now

When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh

[Verse 2]
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout

[Chorus]
Spendin'what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
Oh

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
Whole lot of highway, whole lot of years
Sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago
Oh

364,Craig Morgan,15,This Ole Boy,2012,"

She got her smile on, dog'on nothing in the world's wrong
Rolling down a country road
She's my shotgun rider
I'm the lucky dog beside her
My lips are where her kisses go
She loves when we go to the river and get in the water
And buddy she is hotter than south Georgia in July
Man when I'm with her I can't get enough of her
I got to kiss her and I got to hug her
And brother she's mine all mine

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

We're in my old ford oh lord
Holes in my floor board
But she don't seem to mind
We park in a hay field
Fog up the windshield
My kind of killing time
She sweetens my tea and she butters my biscuit
I am who I am and buddy she gets it
I ain't got to change a thing
And I don't know if it could get any better
But man if it does then i reckon i better get to picking out a ring

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

Yeah, this ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

Yeah this ole boy
Nobody but this ole boy
This ole boy

I know i gotta put in the hours
Make the money while the sunlight shines
But anything i gotta get done

Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer

Waits for me and right now

Don't wanna spend 'em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking
How many kisses have i lost?

[Verse 1]
I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn’t scared at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

[Chorus]
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight

[Verse 2]
You couldn’t see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock, you turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night, good night, baby, goodnight

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Half scared to death can’t catch my breath
Aren’t these the moments we live for

[Chorus]
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight

I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined

[Verse 2]
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller

Since we been over, been trying like crazy to get you out of my head

She starts dancing when the stars come out
She ain’t your typical preacher’s daughter
She’ll leave you dreamin’, yeah there ain’t no doubt

My world's a roller-coaster and my life's a traffic jam
All this mess ain't even close to bein' who I am
I've been dreamin' Carolina, catchin' craw-dads by the creek
But I'm stuck here in this prison cell full of city streets
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
I can smell my mama's cookin'
And the sweet magnolia trees
Nothing like suppertime on a summer night
I can hear those crickets callin' me
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
I need a little time, I need a little space
I need a little gone, a little out of this place
I wanna get back where I can breathe
Where I feel free, yeah
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back, I've been away too long
Take me back to my home sweet home
Kissin' Jenny Lynn on a front porch swing
Catchin' fireflies on the first day of spring
Swingin' along while the church choir sings
Sneakin' around on a full moon night
Makin' out for the very first time
Those were the best days of my life

372,Keith Urban,23,For You,2012,"

[Verse 1]
All I saw was smoke and fire
I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

[Verse 2]
Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would

I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would

I’d do it for you

Trying to live and love with a heart that can't be broken
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened
Yeah, we both carry baggage we picked up on our way
So if you love me, do it gently and I will do the same

[Chorus: Shawna & Keifer Thompson]
We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, 'cause we are glass

[Verse 2: Both]
I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks
And in the darkness of this moment you see the good and bad
But try not to judge me 'cause we've walked down different paths
But it brought us here together

So I won't take that back

We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass

We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake
We might burn like gasoline and fire, it's a chance we'll have to take

We are fragile, we are human and we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, we are glass

Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted

Cause you'll always be wanted

381,Ronnie Dunn,32,Let The Cowboy Rock,2012,"

[Verse 1]
Old boy at the bar with the stagger in his step
Looks like he's been rode hard and put up wet
Heartache's on him like stink on a skunk
He's fightin' off lonely, tryin' to drown it with a drunk

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Verse 2]
Yeah, think he's still a little green, ya'll, he's fresh off the farm
Some pretty little thing put a whoopin' on his heart
He's walkin' to the left, leanin' to the right
Talkin' to himself, puttin' up a fight

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Bridge]
He needs a long rope, boys, cut him some slack
Every now and then you gotta act like that

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Outro]
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

382,Josh Thompson,33,Comin' Around,2012,"

It was like nails on a chalkboard when Daddy played his kinda music
If you'd have asked me then, I'd a said it was borderline abusive
But I'm gettin' to where I don't mind it now
I'm comin' around

I blew out of here the next day after graduation
Destination: anywhere with a higher population
Never to return to this tiny town
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

I've never been that big of gettin' up on Sunday mornin'
And listen to that ol' preacher talk was always kinda borin'
I'm still a little more lost than I am found
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around

I'm comin' around, I'm figurin' out
A lot of things I thought I knew
I never deamed I'd be seein' things
From this point of view
Still a little ways from slowin' it all the way down
But I'm comin' around

Yeah, I'm comin' around

383,Chris Young,34,Neon,2012,"

[Verse 1]
The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is

[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon

[Verse 2]
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented

[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is always neon

[Bridge]
You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer
But my favorite color is

[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon

384,Phil Vassar,35,Don't Miss Your Life,2012,"

On a plane to the West Coast, laptop on my tray
Papers spread across my seat, a big deadline to make
An older man sitting next to me said, ""Sorry to intrude
Thirty years ago my busy friend, I was you
I made a ton of money and I climbed up the ladder
Yeah, I was superman, not what does it matter

I missed the first steps my daughter took
The time my son played Captain Hook in 'Peter Pan'
I was in New York, said 'Sorry son, Dad has to work'
I missed the father daughter dance
The first home run, no second chance
To be there when he crossed the plate
The moment's gone now it's too late
Fame and fortune come with a heavy price
Son, don't miss your life.""

Funny you should say that, I was sitting at the gate
My daughter called, she made straight A's and they're off to celebrate
Scrolling through the pictures of my little family
My daughter with her mom and friends, not a single one with me
They know I love 'em, I know they know I care
The truth is half the time, I'm not even there

I missed our fourth and fifth anniversary
Our girl was early by a week
Her sister had to hold her hand
I was in L.A., she said ""I understand""
I missed her first day of school
Then what kind of crazy fool
Lets such precious moments pass
We all know time goes way too fast
Hold on tight cause it don't happen twice
Don't miss your life

When I get off this plane, I'll buy a turn-around ticket
Saturday's her eighth birthday and I'm not gonna miss it

There'll be balloons and birthday cake
And I'll clean up the mess they make
My mom and dad are drivin' in
I haven't seen 'em in God knows when
My wife will probably say to me
""I thought you were supposed to be in Portland
For a few more days"", I'll take her in my arms and say
""I heard some words that hit me hard last night
A man said: 'Don't miss your life'.""

385,Kix Brooks Featuring Joe Walsh,36,New To This Town,2012,"

I was sittin' at the cafe for a bite
And couldn't help but overhear this guy
He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck
Tell Becky how pumped he was

'Bout movin' here for his new job
And what a cool little spot it was
It kinda made me jealous, it made me mad
Wish I could see this place like that

Yeah, I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town

I can't put my feet on this sidewalk
Without hearing you laugh, and hearing you talk
And every street's a memory
Of just how good it used to be

I can't walk into the corner bar
Without asking how you are
And how you're doing, and how you've been
I gotta go through it all again

I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town

I wonder what it feels like to hop in my truck
Not think about us, just go for a ride
And stop at that stoplight, not think about you
Sittin' here by my side

Yeah, I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
And I feel the way that I do now
Oh, I wish I was new to this town

I wish I was new to this town, oh, yeah
I wish I was new to this town
Oh, yeah

386,George Strait,37,Drinkin' Man,2012,"

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again
I fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble
When you're fourteen and drunk by 10 am
Tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said ""Straighten up""
I just laughed, said, ""You don't understand
That's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man""

[Verse 2]
At sixteen I was on my own and flying high and staying stoned
I knew everything there was to know
I did things that I can't talk about
I wore my mom and daddy out
Late nights they spent praying for my soul
Stayed sober once for nine days in a row
I quit cold turkey and damn near almost made it to ten
But that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

[Chorus]
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

[Verse 3]
I don't know when or where it was or how we met and fell in love
Or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
I tried to pull myself together, hoping we could last forever
For a while I started to believe
Her daddy said, she's all I got
Son, don't ever break her heart
Promise me before you take her hand
But that's just too much to ask of a drinking man

[Chorus]
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

[Outro]
I woke up this morning and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again

387,David Nail,38,The Sound Of A Million Dreams,2012,"

[Verse 1]
Seeger was singing words I could believe in
Main Street was my street at night
So I called on Samantha and asked her the chance
Of us running out 'neath the moonlight
Well, she's not with me now, she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while

[Chorus]
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pourin' my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams

[Verse 2]
My eighteenth summer, I was a cocky up-and-comer
Cranking up Born to Run
Turned left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son
My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you, not I told you so
When I hear Mama Tried, I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road

[Chorus]
And I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams

So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my own voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
The sound of a million dreams

Life is taking turns, falling flat on your chin
Trying to fly with the birds
Love sure is blind
‘cause it don’t see
It ain’t spent one night feelin’ sorry for me
There ain’t too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with your dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin’ on me
Lady love, forgets me every time
I’m spending my days packin’ nickels and dimes
But the man in the moon, yeah he’s alright
He must've flipped on the switch when he left last night
‘cause I’m feeling’ alright, feelin’ alright
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin’ on me
There ain’t too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin’ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain’t sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shinin’ on, shining on, shining on me

[Verse 1]
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

[Chorus]
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh

[Verse 2]
If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't want to fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one

[Chorus]
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out

People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, trying to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world
I can see why they're all talking
Looking back at my past
I've got a bad name but a man can change
I'm living proof of that

[Chorus]
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you

Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around
And baby don't you ever forget

[Chorus]
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
Darling yes I will

Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
Oh babe, till my last day

391,Greg Bates,42,Did It For The Girl,2012,"

I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss

I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight
Anything to make her mine, all mine, I did it for the girl
I did it for the girl

You walked in shining brighter than a headlight
Turning every head like a diamond in a coal mine
Packing more punch than a Mississippi fist fight
Oh oh my my

Walked my way, took my hand, said ""Let's go""
Had more game than the Mandalay Casino
Thought I hit the jackpot, I was on a good roll
Showed you what I know

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

Before I knew it my heartstrings unwound
I fell faster than a cannonball straight down
Everybody talking all over this now:
""Look there he goes again""

Lie lie lied like a politician
Shoulda read the headlines, paid more attention
To my suspicions, my intuition
I shoulda listened

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

I shoulda seen it from a mile away
I should have called a spade a spade
I shoulda known that you're

Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true

Too good to be true

You're just too good to be (too good to be)
You're just too good to be (too good to be)

I'm not your high school crush
Your first love, your first kiss
Guy that crossed you off of his list
I'm not the red taillights that left you behind
Again and again

I'm not your Tennessee pre-med big man
Promised you a ring and took another girl's hand
What's it gonna take to make you understand
I'm not that man

This is me now
Baby, don't doubt
The love I can give to you
You gotta know

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine

I've been your late night call
Your shoulder to cry on
Out on the highway, listening to sad songs
Talk all night 'bout stupid things, makin' you smile

I've been right here
All of these years
I am your man
By now you ought to know

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Girl, after all you've been through
I knew it'd be a matter of time
'Til all those goodbyes made you mine

No more lonely nights
Starin' at your cell phone
No more clinging to a love so cold
With me you'll never have to be alone

I ain't the same ol'
Let you go, run you around
String you along, do you wrong
Like they've done you 'til now

Goodbyes made you mine

Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name
So don't judge me, I'm doing the best I can
Got a damn good reason for this drink in my hand
Got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

No, I didn't see it coming, she was sly as could be
I was crying on her shoulder, he was cheating on me
She never let on that it was her stealing his love
But I wised up

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Good riddance to 'em both, I really don't need them
I was working two jobs, they were fooling around
Crossed my mind to put 'em six feet in the ground
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Trust may be something that I live without
It's gonna take a while to remove my doubt
But everyone around you at some point will let you down
That's how I feel now

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend

Now I heard it through the grapevine, he's tired of her
Guess they're finally getting what they deserve
The last time I saw him, he had the nerve to hit on me
How sleazy can you be?

I got an ex-old man and an ex-best girlfriend
Took his ring off my finger, gave him back his last name

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah

"
401,Darius Rucker,2,Wagon Wheel,2013,"

[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip

Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

And get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip
Don't stop girl...

You know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on

Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on (shine on)
Baby get your shine on
Baby get your shine on

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chromed piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby get your shine on

405,Miranda Lambert,6,Mama's Broken Heart,2013,"

[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

406,Kenny Chesney,7,Pirate Flag,2013,"

[Verse 1]
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Bridge]
Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars

[Outro]
I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

407,Lady Antebellum,8,Downtown,2013,"

[Verse 1]
Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

[Verse 2]
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

[Outro]
Yeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it

408,Luke Bryan,9,Crash My Party,2013,"

[Verse 1]
It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night
Girl, I don’t care, oh, I just gotta see what you’re wearing
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Bridge]
If it’s two in the morning and you’re feeling lonely
And wondering what I’m doing

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 1]
July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream

[Chorus]
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

[Verse 2]
Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

[Chorus]
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
And telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time

[Verse 2]
Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

[Chorus]
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, I know we're crazy, yeah

[Chorus]
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy

Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy

[Bridge]
Yeah, look at us, baby
Tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough
Maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love?
Let's be crazy

Who cares if we're crazy
We gotta be crazy
I know that we're crazy
So let's be crazy
Yeah, yeah

You strung me along for far too long
'Cause I never gave up the fight
Until now

It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars
It’s gonna put you through a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even
But giving what you deserve

Done and all the games you play

But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]

Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does

[Click here to read Blake’s story behind “Sure Be Cool If You Did”]

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

[Bridge: Blake Shelton]
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

[Verse 2]
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

[Chorus]
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 3]
Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

[Verse 4]
Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end

[Chorus]
And as long I live, whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 5]
Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

[Chorus]
As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Verse 2]
I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Outro]
Girl, I'll swear
Just say the word
I'll take you there
Aww anywhere, anywhere with you
Yeah I'll go anywhere with you

Sometimes it feels like, I'm gonna break
Sometimes this world, gives more than I can take
Sometimes, sunshine gets lost in the rain
And it keeps pouring down
It just keeps coming down

[Hook]
This life would kill me If I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you

[Verse 2]
You are my heart, every breath I breathe
I'm safe in your arms, you rescue me
When I'm weak, you're strong
If you were gone I don't know where I'd be
You were made for me
You were made for me

This life would kill me If I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you baby

[Verse 1]
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

[Verse 2]
I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh even though you left me you're still here

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing

Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do

No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you

Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry, 'cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah, I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine

Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her

[Chorus]
So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing
She’s in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I’m supposed to do, yeah
There’s still more than miles in my rear view

I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose

Before I'll see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down

Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part

I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now

If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do

Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck

424,Danielle Bradbery,25,Maybe It Was Memphis,2013,"

Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Every night now once I've been back home
I lie awake at night drifting in my memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
You know it sure felt right

The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Verse 1]
Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Verse 2]
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Bridge]
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
A simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by

[Chorus]
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Outro]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Island lullaby

No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""Girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""It'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road

[Bridge]
Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road

A whole lot of tender and a little bit tough

Rolling around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights
Red light running, good time chasing
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright

At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side

Yea, point at you

Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this

But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home

At least a country mile wide

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows

You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy

Wish I knew how long it's been going on
How long you've been getting some on the side
Nah, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well, he won't be getting any sleep tonight

Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Redneck crazy

Did you think I'd wish you both the best
Endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am
Yeah, I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows

I've loved holy, I've loved sin
I was rolling on the wind
It didn't matter

I was so sure of who I didn't want to be
Every smile and every fear
Every laugh and every tear
It was all mine, it was all me

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

We've all been lied to
We've all been liars
Nothing's perfect in this world
Everybody's been burned by the fire
Guess I'm learning
That what breaks you, makes you grow
But I'm not hiding where I've been
Gonna let the light shine in
What I don't need
Gonna let that, let that, let that go

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be
I don't even know
I gave a lot to lovers
Gave a lot to friends
Everything I took from them
Made me who I am
Pieces

Pieces, the good and the bad
Pieces, the happy and sad
Pieces, the wrong and the right
Pieces, that's my, that's my, that's my life

Pieces of my heart
Pieces of my soul
Pieces that I'm gonna be

Gave a lot to friends

The way you got me grinning
You know I'll climb up in your rusty truck
I give up, come on over, pick me up

Back roads no lines, high beam headlights

I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get barefoot and buckwild

[Verse 2]
(Let's go!)
You're showin' off in circles down by the riverside
You like to make me nervous so I move in real tight
Come on throw it in park
I wanna see the stars and feel the grass between my toes
Dancing to the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you got me where you want me
Lost in the country

[Chorus]
You slide me over little love shootin' shotgun
Hands out the window, got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging red mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get barefoot and buckwild

[Bridge]
I don't know how you do what you do
But you do what you do and it does what it does to me
I can't stop it once you start it

[Chorus]
You slide me over little love shootin' shotgun
Hands out the window, got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging red mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get

[Verse 1]
We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach – I’d rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, that’s not true

[Chorus]
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

[Verse 2]
We’ll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
We’ll play Jack Johnson, he’s the new Don Ho
And we’ll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio

[Chorus]
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

[Verse 3]
Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love

[Bridge]
You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy

[Chorus]
But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day

Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home

Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...
Go on a little holiday...

[Verse 1:  Karen]
On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly

[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

[Verse 2: Jimi]
On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now

[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

[Verse 3]
Aren't you even going to make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?

[Chorus x2]
How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

On your side of the bed
Are you still awake, on your side of the bed

Out here on the back side of that city limit sign where the world turns two lanes
Pretty girl working at the bank and the fella topping off your tank knows your name
Water tower, power lines, swimming holes, rusty old RC Cola signs and county fairs
Raise your hand if you’ve been there

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars

Well, I’ve been there on the concrete of them big city streets in my Ford truck
Traffic jam in the town square, told my buddies living up there, good luck
Meanwhile back in Tennessee we’re raising our babies and our own green beans and kicking up dust
Come on down when you’ve had enough

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars

Where there’s biscuits, grits, and gravy
And the waitress calls you baby
And the star lights like a street light on a summer night
We say hell yeah and Amen, yeehaw and y’all come back again
And pray that our boys come home alive
And when ole glory flies we still hold our hands over our hearts
Where there’s more trucks than cars
Where there’s more trucks than cars

[Verse 1]
You're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know

[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

[Verse 2]
I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause

[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

[Verse 3]
As if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill

[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

Everybody down in Houston calls him ""Texas""
Everybody way up North calls him ""Cornbread""
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him ""baby""
Daddy called him ""boy"", his friends call him ""crazy""

[Chorus]
Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him ""whiskey""

Warm my body to the core just like a blanket
His face was so sweet then he took my breath away
Hit me so hard like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me

Now the numb has set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain

I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, Eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then

[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed

I got a lot of “Hey, I’m sorry's""
The things I’ve done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that
Tell 'em that

I got off track

Back slid my way

Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze, baby get ready
Across the field where the creek turns back
By the old stump row
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows baby get ready
You and me go fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with you
Spring is almost over and the summer's come
The And days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along, baby get ready
And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night, baby get ready
You and me go fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with you
You and me go fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows, down by the river
In the full moonlight we'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night

Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you

Love; something you know nothing of
'Cause love don't turn and run
And leave you standing in the dark
You, tell me that your feelings changed
And you don't wanna stay and break my heart
Well baby, it's too late

'Cause what about the times that you said to me
That I was everything that you'd ever need?
How come you just up and walk away
And look me in the eye and say

You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love
You did it all for love

Love; what was I supposed to do?
Falling out can be so cruel
But I just can't ignore the truth
So, don't tell me I don't understand
'Cause I don't want this on my hands
But it's all that's left to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everything you want's what we used to be
And I can't fight these feelings inside of me
As much as this hurts, it's the only way
Believe me when I say

So we had a few drinks
Had some laughs at the bar
Stayed out too late
And went a little too far
Oh but wakin' up
With you on my chest
I had a pounding heart, and achin' head, and no regrets

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

Rule number one
Friends don't break
We could write it off
As a sweet mistake
Only time will tell
If we were wrong or right
All I know is I don't want to be alone tonight

Who knows, we might go down in flames
But then again I might just change your name

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now
It's worth sticking around to see
Is this love
Or could it be

We wound up here so naturally
Me and you baby
You and me
Could it be
Could it be

Could it be I'm finally holding
What I've been hoping for
Could it be the end of just friends
And the start of something more
Oh the way I'm feeling now

Is this love
Or could it be

It's hard to understand the way I'm living
I know she thinks I'm never coming home (never coming home)
But I miss her pretty smile, and I'm coming back in a little while

Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
Raisin' a little hell and praising the Lord (yes sir)

Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keepin'
You tried and true, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one’s for you, woo

Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song

Yeah, I know what I’m talkin' about
I grew up in them rural routes
Counting down them days 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my sights, I’m gonna do it up right

Kickin' it in the big town, wishin' I'd a slowed it down
And I give anything if I was drivin' around
With the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don’t know how good they got it

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again

The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb, thumpin' on the wheel right

Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up
Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine

Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like ""Honey, I sure want you""
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar

And waitin' on the right time to make my move

456,Miranda Lambert,7,Automatic,2014,"

[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Post-Chorus]
Automatic

Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance

[Chorus]
Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

[Verse 2]
I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

[Chorus]
You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music

We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh, and you were like

[Bridge]
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Outro]
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, want to drink them up

Shed a light on everything that used to be

I didn't want the night to end too soon
I said, ""It's getting late, do you need to go?""
And she said no

I was like
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, if you say so
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Here it go

[Verse 1]
Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Verse 2]
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Bridge]
However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away

[Chorus 2]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank

467,Billy Currington,18,We Are Tonight,2014,"

[Verse 1]
Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

The night's still young, never going to get old
Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 2]
Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
Were flying so high like we're never gonna crash

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 3]
We are tonight, we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Outro]
We are tonight
Everything we want to be, yeah
We are, we are, we are tonight
Yeah
We are tonight

It ain’t in a high rise looking for a good time shutting down the city lights
It ain’t in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain’t where it is

[Chorus]
It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at

It ain’t in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain’t to my right

[Verse 1]
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

471,The Band Perry,22,Chainsaw,2014,"

[Verse 1]
We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time

[Chorus]
And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you

[Chorus]
But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw

[Bridge]
I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote ""Forever"" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down... tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's gotta go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw
(Woo!)

[Verse 1]
She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Verse 2]
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Bridge]
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

Yeah, I like doing what she likes

474,Hunter Hayes,25,Invisible,2014,"

[Verse 1]
Crowded hallways are the loneliest places
For outcasts and rebels
Or anyone who just dares to be different
And you've been trying for so long
To find out where your place is
But in their narrow minds
There's no room for anyone who dares to do something different
Oh, but listen for a minute

[Chorus]
Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Those words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
Someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
Oh, invisible

[Verse 2]
So your confidence is quiet
To them, quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Every heart has a rhythm
Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore
Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different
Dare to be something more

[Chorus]
Trust the one
Who's been where you are wishing all it was
Was sticks and stones
Yeah, the words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more of this life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible

[Bridge]
These labels that they give you
Just 'cause they don't understand
If you look past this moment
You'll see you've got a friend
Waving a flag for who you are
And all you're gonna do
Yeah, so here's to you
And here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible

[Final Chorus]
Yeah
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
And someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
It'll be invisible

She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

[Verse 2]
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are

[Verse 1]
Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
Where a good old boy like me still has a chance

[Bridge]
Aw, this is where I was born and this is where I'll die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I will die

[Chorus]
It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south
All about the south

[Verse 2]
From daddy's Don Williams to mama's Patsy Cline
We're walking after midnight singing Tulsa time
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
This is where I was born this is where I'll die, oh that's right

[Chorus]
It's all about the south

Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty

Come on down, come on down

Might as well have my alarm
Set on my phone girl

Come around 10:47 every Friday night
Might as well leave the light on
'Cause you're always right on time

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in

It's like I'm walking down the street
And fall in that same trap girl

And I just stand there on the tracks girl
Somebody'd be getting rich if they were placing bets
On me thinking no, no, no, always saying yes

Sun gone down, nights are getting hotter
We've got this bed backed up to the water
Yeah it's the place to be if you wanna see every little shining star
But that view ain't nothing like the you I'm lookin at
Two tan legs for days dangling off the back
It all looks better baby you can see forever when you're here in my arms

I thought things couldn't get much worse
But guess what they did
You hit my heart upside with a wrecking ball
Oh but that's what I get
But I'm not going nowhere
I can live on my prayers
'Cause I'm done playin' nice
I'm done running for life
'Cause you think that you got me scared

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Everyone can save their breath
They can spare me the change
You can point your finger somewhere else
If you're looking to blame

I'll give you something to believe
Nothing on me says defeat
No I'll never look back
So you better think fast
If you think you can cut me deep

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Hey, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet

Hey!
Well it's going to take more, going to take more, going to take more, to pull me under
Going to take more, going to take more, going to take more than that to pull me under!

This time it's goodbye trouble
I feel the light at the end of this tunnel
I get stronger with every step

Come Hell, come high water
You push on me I'm going to push back harder
I got a whole lot more than a little bit left
Oh, so don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Oh, don't put dirt on my grave just yet
Don't put dirt on my grave just yet

491,Kip Moore,42,Dirt Road,2014,"

When a preacher talks of heaven, he paints it real nice
He says, you better get to livin', better get to livin' right
If you're gonna get your mansion, he's been saving for your soul
If you're gonna do your dancing on city streets of gold

But unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

You better quit your drinking, you better quit your smoking too
Be for trading in your backseat Saturday nights for Sunday morning pew
Well, I've never been nothing, nothing more than what you see
Like my truck, I'm made for running, down to a midnight creek

So unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

All of this flying high, gonna leave ya falling short
Leave you knock, knock, knocking on heaven's basement door
But one thing's for sure

Unless it's got a dirt road leading down to a fishing hole
With a little piece of moonlight, a couple cans of Bud Light
Where I can cuddle with my baby and I can pull her real close
No, I don't wanna go unless heaven's got a dirt road

I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could bring you down
Just for a second, teach you a lesson
About being alone in the dark
I wish I could make you cry
So hard you can barely breathe
And maybe you just might know what it feels like
Mmm, to be me

[Chorus]
Well, the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you, baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under
Throw you back a little thunder, even though I never would
Oh, I wish I could break
I wish I could break your heart
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I wish I could crash your dreams
I wish I could turn back time
Boy, I'd lead you on
Light the fuse, drop the bomb
Just so I'd be the first to leave

[Chorus]
Well, the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you, baby
But it'd be nice to know that I could
Be strong enough to pull you under
Throw you back a little thunder, even though I never would
Oh, I wish I could break
I wish I could break your heart

Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growing
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever OK, OK let me tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone

[Verse 2]
You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong

It goes when you're wrong

Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then something comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man

[Bridge]
I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone

And it was all alright
Now it's all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're long long gone

I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

502,Florida Georgia Line,3,Sippin' On Fire,2015,"

[Verse 1]
Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

[Chorus]
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire

[Verse 2]
You act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feeling when we're burning the midnight down again

[Chorus]
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire

[Bridge]
Every goodbye is bitter sweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

[Chorus]
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire

You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria

Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

504,A Thousand Horses,5,Smoke,2015,"

She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
Like smoke, ooh, ooh
Like smoke ooh, ooh

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

When the night burns out
And we all go home
Smell of sweet perfume
All over your clothes
She's smoke, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

[Verse 2]
I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

And a guy walks into a bar

We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over

I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'

Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time

I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't

Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die

[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Bridge]
Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on

Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars

A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye

So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come

Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong
Raise 'em up right from wrong
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess
She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows
Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

Some just have to chase the sun

Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

A kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
So simple yet experimental
Innocent but still a little wild child

Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

You, look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and

That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rocking, foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She wasn't once upon a time
She used to dance when the band played
She used to be the trustin' kind

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys roll away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

She don't love you
She don't love you, she's just lonely

I remember her when she was mine, mine

But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Verse 2]
I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Bridge]
Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Outro]
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at party
Good at the bar
Something bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're looking so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

520,Luke Bryan,21,Games,2015,"

[Verse 1]
You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
And you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

[Chorus]
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

[Verse 2]
The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

[Chorus]
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

[Bridge]
This break-up, make-up,hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me
What am I supposed to do with you?

[Chorus]
And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

521,Brad Paisley,22,Crushin' It,2015,"

I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear ""you're killing it, dude"", yeah it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah I'll be crushin' it

They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh I'll be crushin' it

I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

And every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, every weekend's a weekend
Yeah I'll be crushin' it, by this time Friday night
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it, of cold Bud Light
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be crushin' it

[Verse: 1]
So I guess it's over, baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Bridge]
That's right
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I’m tipsy
And I ain’t even had a drink

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights

Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat

Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On The Way Down

You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath

Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is, is I always have to guess

You make all my screws come loose

Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars

If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

Drinking too much and playing too loud, where there’s a scar I carved it out

I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time

Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

[Verse 2]
I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

[Chorus]
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

[Verse 3]
You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

[Chorus]
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him

Pretty as a daisy, careful if you pick me
This wildflower can get a little crazy, baby

If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone

Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be...asking for trouble

I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying ""Keep it down""
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind

[Bridge]
I said, ""Hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over?""
You say, ""No way"" then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot

[Chorus]
My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
You look good in my t-shirt, baby
Yeah
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
You look good in my t-shirt
Yeah, I think you look good in my t-shirt, uh

Oh, you look so good in my t-shirt

Kissin' you would hit the spot with me

Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight

Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight

[Verse 1]
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Verse 2]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya

Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing

Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer

[Verse 1]
The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Outro]
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time

The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

[Pre-Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Oh no, here I go

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Oh no, here I go

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?

And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart

I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time

Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now

Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright

Yeah, they're ringin'

Gets so loud that no one listens

Trapped in our phones and we can't make it
Stop, stop this noise

All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy

[Verse 3: Dan & Shay]
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still

[Chorus 3: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

570,Sam Hunt,21,Make You Miss Me,2016,"

[Verse 1]
You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

[Verse 2]
You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

[Bridge]
Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me

[Outro]
Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me

[Verse 1]
It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush T-shirt
Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, whatcha doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

[Pre-Chorus]
It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

[Verse 3]
It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on, and on

[Bridge]
So let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets
To the ones that you ain't met yet

[Chorus]
In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on

The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Verse 2]
It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

Cue the music out the driveway
Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she's gonna be late
Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it's a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

[Pre-Chorus]
You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day's gone and the night's on fire

[Chorus]
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh, ooohh

[Verse 2]
She's a seat laid back, a boy's dream
Drawin' hearts in the window steam
She's a gettin' you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline
When you know what you're headed to
What's a red blooded boy to do

[Chorus]
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire,oohh
She's telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire
Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire, oohh

You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, and it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes
Tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up

[Chorus]
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

[Verse 2]
I didn't have much money, but I covered them rounds
Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren’t shooting on whiskey, just shooting the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it

[Chorus]
There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer

[Bridge]
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Here’s to you baby
So tonight lets raise ‘em up to where we ended up

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years

Oh, it all started with a beer

Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone

In the middle of an old school country song

Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah

I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives

Every time I chew
Got a hole in my boots

Got a hole in my jeans
Been working so hard
They're about to fall apart
At the seams
I got a hole in my jeans

It's a Friday night
And I'm out on the town
Man you know you're gonna
Find me somewhere

There's a hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
There's a hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

There's a hole in the wall
Where the neon lights
Shine bright as a disco ball
That's my hole in the wall

Well I got a hole in my heart
I can slide right up to some
Pretty little thing at the bar
Pass that hole in my heart

You can pop a top
You can twist that lid
Doesn't really matter
Just as long as you get

That hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
That hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

I don't care if it's from Tennessee
Kentucky or Denver, Colorado
Make it from wheat, make it from corn
I don't really care
Just make it pour

From that hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight

But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me

You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday

[Outro]
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)

587,Zac Brown Band,38,Castaway,2016,"

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight

I’m in an island state of mind
Don’t think I’m ever gonna leave
I’d rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
Castaway

[Chorus]
Castaway
Ride the waves like we’re young
‘Cause time flies by and soon we’ll be older
It’s better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway, castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight)

588,Brothers Osborne,39,21 Summer,2016,"

[Verse 1]
Now and then
I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
And even though its been so long it brings me back
Right back to you

[Chorus]
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me

How you been I'd love to hear bout how you've been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had, and love to have again

[Chorus]
I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me
Yeah you made a man of me

589,William Michael Morgan,40,I Met A Girl,2016,"

[Verse 1]
She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl

[Verse 2]
The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world

[Bridge]
She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

[Chorus]
I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl

[Verse 1]
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

[Verse 2]
​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again

​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?

​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you

​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay

​Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
​Sometimes I break down and cry

Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​Hey, hey, what can I say?

Out with my friends and here it goes again
Somebody asks me where you're at
I don't know what to say, I've tried you everyday
It's been so long since you've called
I'll bet your having a real good time
But I hate to think of what you're doing tonight
And who you're holding close. I don't really wanna know

Who you've been lovin lately
Who you've been callin baby
Who you've been runnin around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin baby. Who ya been lovin lately?

I thought that I could trust the way we made love
You made me feel it was something real
Now everything you've said is lying in our bed
Like shattered glass against my back
The way you got me just blows my mind
Didn't care enough to even say goodbye
I'd give anything now if I could stop thinking about

Who you've been lovin lately
Who you've been callin baby
Who you've been runnin around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin baby. Who ya been lovin lately?

Yeah who ya been lovin lately

I don't wanna know, but I've gotta know
I don't wanna know...I've gotta know [x2]

Who you've been lovin lately
Who you've been callin baby
Who you've been runnin around in this tell all town
I guess you've finally got the best of me
I guess you thought I'd never see
You know it's so hard to believe how we came down
Like we were nothin baby. Who ya been lovin lately?

Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up

From the smell of your hair on the pillow case

[Verse 1]
I’m so confused
I know I heard You loud and clear
So, I followed through
Somehow I ended up here
I don’t wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All I’ve got is hurt and these four words

[Chorus 1]
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

[Verse 2]
I know You’re good
But this don’t feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
It’s hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that You’re God
And I am not
So

[Chorus 2]
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
So

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You hear me, Lord

Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold

Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down

Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute

Everybody said we wouldn’t make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reasons just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us

[Chorus]
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

[Verse 2]
Put on a little old Keith Whitley
Back porch dancin’ singin’ with me
I’m no stranger to the rain, no, no we ain’t
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain

[Chorus]
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

[Verse 3]
Look at us we got a life out here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last year’s deer
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hangin’
Kids in the back just a tire swingin’
Fireworks booming and banging
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

[Chorus]
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Oh, oh, yeah

What do you think about that?

Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over, couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park, hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around
Wasn't scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn, if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it

[Chorus 1]
Cause I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time

[Verse 2]
People slowing down, wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want no one to see me this way
Don't need no gas, don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just right
I just need another minute or two
'Til this song's over like me and you

I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight

Yeah, baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time

Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, but I'm here like this
Off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside

No, it ain't the truck this time

There's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
A lack of sleep poundin' in my head
We both regret some of the things we said
But we love the way it ends

[Pre-Chorus 1: Brad Paisley & Both]
Sometimes I think
We hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
And sometimes I think
We're fighting just to be lovers and all so needlessly

[Chorus: Both]
Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight

They say don't go to bed angry, that's true
But it's really something when we do
(Madder you make me, the more I want you)
Girl, I admit

Sometimes I think
It couldn't be any better
(And I couldn't want you more)
And sometimes I think

Confusing love and war

Good as we are at gettin' it on
How come we just can't get along?
The way we love, it don't seem right
The way we fuss, the way we fight
I got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight
We make up without a fight

We can make up without a fight

First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Tangled up in the tall grass

On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

602,Luke Combs,3,Hurricane,2017,"

[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 1]
The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Verse 2]
Like your dress on the floor
Yeah the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you

He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

605,Darius Rucker,6,If I Told You,2017,"

[Verse 1]
What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?

[Verse 1]
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside

A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight

But they're gonna shine with you're up inside

Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'ing my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods looking like Panama City
A bunch of jacked up trucks and bikinis
Got a Yeti full of good ideas
Like I ain't worried 'bout driving, I'mma stay right here

Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again

Somebody said something 'bout church on Sunday, amen
Somebody said something 'bout work on Monday
Shh, don't say it again

Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you

Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet

Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help

I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner

She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner

616,Chris Stapleton,17,Either Way,2017,"

[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 1: Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott]
On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

[Chorus: Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott]
They're like, ""Hey, who that there with the shades?""
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in

You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott]
Black dress to the nines, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me

[Chorus: Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott]
Like, ""Hey, who that there with the shades?""
Like oh, the way you move to the bass

One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks

People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions

Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

[Verse 2]
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much

Baby, it's yours if you want it

[Post-Chorus]
It's yours if you want it

[Bridge]
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it

[Verse 1]
He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

[Verse 2]
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

[Chorus]
My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

[Break]

[Chorus]
My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins

She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning

She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Keep your chin up
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

[Chorus]
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Verse 2]
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Bridge]
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (like there's no such thing)
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world

Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working

Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost state ten to nine
And I cried, ""man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times

Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Oh five more minutes

What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (away)
What if?

632,Brett Eldredge,33,Somethin' I'm Good At,2017,"

[Intro]
Get ready to go crazy right here
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Verse 2]
I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee (That's right)
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Bridge 1]
Playin' hard to get are ya?
Let me tell ya a little more about ya, and why I love ya

[Verse 3]
Damn you're a looker
You're the cane, you're the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading (Ain't ya baby?)
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh 'til I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all my money on you all over this town

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at

You thought it was over?

[Bridge 2]
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at

Hahaha
Cut!

[Verse 1]
Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Post-Chorus]
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

[Verse 2]
Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Bridge]
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Outro]
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?

634,Kenny Chesney,35,Bar At The End Of The World,2017,"

[Verse 1]
There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

[Verse 2]
In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called ""Make Me Disappear""

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll throw the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

[Bridge]
There ain't no empty glasses
They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

[Chorus]
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

[Outro]
To the bar at the end of the world

At the end of the world

[Verse 1]
Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah

[Chorus]
So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

Your soul is pure golden
Must’ve been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

It’s been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn’t make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made …

Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

Worn and haggard, weathered and torn
Drug through the keyhole of that back door
Blood shot red behind these shades
I look like hell, yes, I've seen better days

[Chorus]
And then those loving arms they pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

I'm rust on a barbed wire, I'm dust on a chrome yeah
Yes I'm the heart that bleeds in an old country song

And then those loving arms they pull me back in
And there you go, baby, yeah, making me look good again

Leather and lace, denim and pearls
Whiskey and wine, they go just fine, like you and me, girl
When you smile at me and say, there ain't no better place
Than you'd rather be than right here loving me

[Bridge]
Standing in that kitchen, it's been a long day at work
Then you slip those hands right under my shirt

There you go, baby, making me look good again

My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

[Chorus]
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playin' with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

It made the man I am today

[Chorus]
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from

Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreamin' one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flyin' high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

[Verse 1]
The postman delivered, a ""past due"" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee

[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

[Verse 2]
Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, ""It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete

[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

[Verse 3]
So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

Was to have you walk out on me

And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby I was wrong

All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah

It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, ""Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now""
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud

How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?

Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

Yeah, she's moving through my mind

Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

I stayed till closing time
My little mystery

649,Brad Paisley,50,Last Time For Everything,2017,"

[Verse 1]
Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 2]
Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, ""Let's leave it long in the back""
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything

[Verse 3]
Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

[Verse 4]
Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 5/Outro]
Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be

See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (Sing it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (C'mon)
Baby, just let it be (Let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes (Come for a ride)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be (Yeah)

This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful

Could be better than this

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go

Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

Make it easy with every little thing you do

653,Luke Combs,4,One Number Away,2018,"

[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away

654,Dan + Shay,5,Tequila,2018,"

[Verse 1]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)

[Bridge]
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down

With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer

656,Kenny Chesney,7,Get Along,2018,"

[Verse 1]
Met a man wearin' a t-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

657,Blake Shelton,8,I Lived It,2018,"

[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

[Verse 1]
You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Verse 2]
Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Bridge]
Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time, oh
You did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time, yeah
You did something for the first time?

Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever

And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask

Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no

Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands

As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said ""yes m'am"", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2]
So I nodded my head and said, ""that's for sure""
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on, sing it with me
There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on and sing it with me

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)

Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy

"
664,Carrie Underwood,15,Cry Pretty,2018,"

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah

[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

666,Jake Owen,17,I Was Jack (You Were Diane),2018,"

[Verse 1]
It was yesterday
It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away

[Chorus]
Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we were never growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to 16 as long as you can
Every time that it comes on

[Chorus]
Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Does it still move you?
Baby, Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane

[Outro]
Yeah, way back
Way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, let the memories take you back
Take you back
Take you back

Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two

So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying

A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you

Run away, run away from love

Say ""I think I love her"" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in

Even though we'd break up in the end

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke

I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody

So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain

Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe

678,Chris Janson,29,Drunk Girl,2018,"

[Verse 1]
Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home

[Chorus 2]
You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush, you're the rush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of

[Chorus]
Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

[Verse 2]
I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes

Oh, don't try to save me
Oh, you never gonna save me

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes

Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
What you do me is criminal, criminal

Don't act like I couldn't see you coming for a hundred miles
Don't try to find the perfect words
Can't take the pain out of the hurt
Hit me hard, baby I can take it
It's your move, go on and make it

To the bag packed, first love leaver
The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of Mama's peach pie

[Verse 2]
To the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lights

[Chorus]
Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man

Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

We've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots

684,Old Dominion,35,Hotel Key,2018,"

[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an ""I'm okay"", ""things are great""
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine

[Verse 2]
Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
And Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God, I blamed myself
Then I found my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing

I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh

All these old pains
And I wish they'd go away
But I guess you can't be free without a fight

I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

[Verse 2]
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies

I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah

[Interlude]
I really do

[Bridge]
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
""For worse or for better"" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight

Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs

I hate love songs

I wanna be the difference

[Intro]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah, you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl

[Verse 1]
You're an angel, you're a keeper, the kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin' every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
Yeah, and they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw, so good baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes I dream 'bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be you and me watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses (What else?)
I'll still be holdin' your hand (What else?)
I still look at you and I pinch myself, good Lord I'm a lucky man

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw, so good baby

[Bridge]
I was lost in the neon lights 'til the day that you called me yours
And they say when you know you know, and I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good girl 'cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you, can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw, so good baby

[Outro]
('Cause I got myself a) good girl
(Still can't believe I) I found you
Good Lord, I'm a lucky man
I could take you home to mama, take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world and made it so good girl
Aw, so good baby

695,Chris Stapleton,46,Millionaire,2018,"

[Chorus 1]
They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

"
696,Kacey Musgraves,47,Space Cowboy,2018,"

[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

697,Kacey Musgraves,48,Butterflies,2018,"

[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you

[Chorus 1]
Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new all because of you

[Chorus 1]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

[Chorus 2]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

698,Dan + Shay,49,All To Myself,2018,"

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Verse 1]
The ones that I drank all those beers with
Made it through those high school years with
All those girls I loved who broke my heart
All those back roads I drove 'round on
That church pew that I got found on
That college town where I first got my start

[Chorus]
All the haters, all the lovers
All the friends that are more like brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
All the faces in the bleachers, the never gave up on me teachers
Yeah this one's for the ones who got me here

[Verse 2]
The ones that said I'd never make it
The ones that said there's your chance, go take it
Took all of you for me to get this far
Jobs along the way that paid me
People that dug deep to raise me
Made me who I am, you know who you are

[Chorus]
All the haters, all the lovers
All the friends that are more like brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
All the faces in the bleachers, the never gave up on me preachers
Yeah this one's for the ones who got me here

[Bridge]
The ones still around, the ones that are gone
My biggest fan, Mama back home
All the truth and all the dares
All the long shot late-night prayers

All the haters, all the lovers
My dad and my two brothers
All the people I ain't seen in too many years
And I thank God that I met ya
Hope you know I won't forget ya

700,Blake Shelton,1,God's Country,2019,"

[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (Yeah)

[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

[Bridge]
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing

[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool for her

Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

Heart racing like it's Daytona

Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate

Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

I wonder what he's doing

Feeling like a fool

Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate

I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't

Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?

What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby

Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?

Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God, you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God, you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Bridge]
I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum

Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings

Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move

That hair needs to come down

What Friday nights need to do

All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

[Verse 2]
All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume

I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else

Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking

Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Some of it

Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Verse 2]
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Bridge]
It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Verse 2]
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Outro]
Yeah, ooh

725,Justin Moore,26,The Ones That Didn't Make It Back Home,2019,"

[Verse 1]
Tour was up middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door around two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Verse 2]
The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of
His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half priced that night
And everybody raised 'em high singin'

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Bridge]
Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones that didn't make it back home

726,Kacey Musgraves,27,Rainbow,2019,"

[Verse 1]
When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Verse 2]
If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Bridge]
Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Outro]
It'll all be alright

"
727,Keith Urban,28,We Were,2019,"

[Verse 1]
We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

[Chorus]
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

[Outro]
My friends say
""Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her""
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were

728,Dierks Bentley,29,Living,2019,"

[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living

729,Cole Swindell,30,Love You Too Late,2019,"

[Verse 1]
I wish this whiskey would make her miss me
Like I wish she did, I wish she did
Pouring up another one won't change what I should have done
Before she left, now all that's left is

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Verse 2]
I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I had half a clue
Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Bridge]
Yeah, I should've held her close
I should've let her know
How I felt about her 'bout a couple county lines ago

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Outro]
Yeah
I love you too late
I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, damn I would

"
730,Tenille Townes,31,Somebody's Daughter,2019,"

[Verse 1]
I drive home the same way
Two left turns off the interstate
And she's always standing
At the stoplight on 18th Street
She could be a Sarah
She could be an Emily
An Olivia, maybe Cassidy
With the shaky hands
On the cardboard sign
And she's lookin' at me

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
And I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter

[Verse 2]
Did she give up wondering where the cars all go?
And can she even tell that I don't know what to say?
So I just nod my head and wave
Well, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be
Or why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography
And whether it shines or rains

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder how she felt when no one caught her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter

[Bridge]
Oh, I don't know the reasons why
I'm the one who's driving by
And she's the one on the corner of 18th Street

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend
Back when she was somebody's sister
Bet she was somebody's first kiss
Dancing in a gym where the kids all talk about someday, someday
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter

[Verse 1]
Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

[Verse 2]
Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

[Verse 3]
I saw ""hungry"" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said ""Roll Tide""
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

[Verse 4]
Ran into a buddy, he said ""How long's it been?""
I said ""A couple years,"" he said ""Boy, it's been ten""
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

[Post-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Verse 5]
I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you

Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

Oh, she does

There's a diamond sky that's waitin' for us just outside of town

Well since we been done
I’ve been trying to un-fall apart
And I’ve been thinking that some neon lights
Would be a real good start

So I guess I’m going out on my own
I might be heart broke
But that don’t mean that I gotta stay home, yeah

That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah

Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again

You were singin' in the same key as me

Puttin' miles on a run-down van

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

[Bridge]
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band

[Verse 1]
It ain't New York City
And it ain’t LA
We ain't got no rooftop bars
Like they do on Broadway

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just a little town square, middle of nowhere
Ain’t even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot
With the little bit that we got

[Chorus]
We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some George Strait songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there’s nothing to do?
Who said there’s nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, our way of living, no it ain't complicated
Don’t knock it 'til you try it, yeah, you might not hate it
Around here we work and we play, cuss and we pray
And at the end of a long, hard day

[Chorus]
We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon’s up high
With your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Brooks & Dunn songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just a little town square, middle of nowhere
Ain't even big enough to be a map dot
We ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot
With the little bit that we got

[Chorus]
We got a little somethin'-somethin' we can throw on ice
Find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high
With your girl and your boys, by a fire making noise
In a field on a Friday night
We got some Tim McGraw songs that we turn up loud
Livin' it up 'til the sun comes back around
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do?
Who said there's nothing to do
In this nothing-to-do town?

Our little nothing-to-do town

740,Matt Stell,41,Prayed For You,2019,"

[Verse 1]
I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for you

[Verse 1]
I ain't watching TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain’t got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth
I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
Man, there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]
I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes

[Verse 2]
I ain’t tryna hear the negative
I’m just tryna change the narrative
It's simply imperative
That we all have a damn good time

[Chorus]
I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain’t gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes

[Bridge]
I got a good girl
She got a good smile
I kiss her good morning
I kiss her good night
We keep it on the up
That's how we get down
So don't be coming around

[Chorus]
Unless you got them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes
Yeah

And mamas from the PTA
We got bachelorettes dressed up in white
And little black dress divorcees

Long live the blues
They're keeping me in business
Some wanna dance and some wanna party
Whatever they need, they call me

[Chorus]
Mr. Lonely, Mr. Good-Time
Mr. One-You're-Gonna-Want-On-A-Saturday-Night
When you're lonely, lying in the dark

The one all the girls are talking about
The one and only, Mr. Lonely

Yeah, some are in from outta town
Just lookin' for some fun
For a couple of hours or more
Yeah, I can be the one

Long live the blues

You can find me in the book or on a bathroom wall
When they all want a rendezvous, they call

Oh, play that steel, Paul

[Bridge]
So if you got a girl, you better treat her right
You better never tell a lie
You better never start a fight
'Cause when she hangs up on you
Guess who's on the other line?
He's never hard to find

[Chorus]
Mr. Lonely, Mr. Good-Time
Mr. One-You're-Gonna-Want-On-A-Saturday-Night
When you're lonely, lying in the dark
I'm the number that you know by broken heart
No, I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right-Now
The one all the girls are talking about
The one and only, Mr. Lonely
The one and only, Mr. Lonely
Long live the blues

We bought that champagne for New Year’s, we got one bottle left
Let's pop it open, baby what you say?
Stay in that T-shirt, you don’t need to get dressed
'Cause we got plans to make no plans today

I'm thinking happy hour, on the hour
In the kitchen, in the shower
Dancing tipsy, come and kiss me baby

Let's get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk

Remember that bottle of whiskey that we bought for your dad
Yeah we got time to buy another one before his birthday, right?
Let's make today the best that we've ever had
'Cause I'm high on your smile and when you look at me that way

No you don't need no makeup, leave your hair up
Ain't no guest list, girl it's just us
Before the sun sets, baby let's get crazy

And get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah-yeah

I'm thinking happy hour, on the hour
Get a good buzz on and now we're
Dancing tipsy, sing it with me baby

And get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk (Who cares!) yeah when you're...

People dressed like they're in Panama

Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow

Daddy drove a beat up Ford
Mama made it run on love and music

All the songs that got me dreaming

I was raised on radio waves
Where the ladies dominated
Sometimes I close my eyes and just replay it

Teased up bangs
