just don't kiss and tell\nYou ain't gotta tweet me, my digits is in your cell\nPlease no Instagram, a picture can only tell\nA thousand words, have a million positions all to yourself\nMy personal life is private, my public life is a riot\nWrite on so many planes, my pen of choice is a pilot\nDiffent currensy, different customs, my body is tired\nBut everything is working out, so yeah, I decided to dye it\nLost a couple of LB's, no more triple XL tees\nAnd my pythons look like anacondas, you'll yell please\nIf I put you in that sleeper, plot a Joell squeeze\nThen tighten it to your knees, Give in and you spell Z's\nYou know I can really fight, right nigga?\nYour man'll think I'm wrong if the right, right'll hit ya\nYour face gone look like a great white bite ripture\nTwo evenings in a row, yeah, night, night nigga\nI've been jumping hurdles since Excitebite, nigga\nYou probably was with your sister making light bright pictures\nI came up in the projects, you niggas ain't that wild\nWalking up the stairs I was crunching up crack vowels\nWalking outside, I was ducking their clap louds\nSounded like a M.O.P. kind of record, click clack blow\nSee, stand-up niggas get easily sat-down\nAnd the cops get there three hours later for pat-downs\nI've been rhyming forever, forever been seeming short\nInfinity is like a blur, I'll never run out of thought\nBroke as a motherfucker, I still held down the fort\nRespect don't have a price tag, some things can't be bought\nI was schooled by the OG's, right up under the action\nBottom of 40 tapping, right there on Kingsland and Jackson\nDopeboy fashion, ropes, gold caps, Girbauds and Bo Jacksons\nWhen starter hats was snapping\nFunny, I'm just rhyming, y'all listening like I'm snapping\nAny rapper indirects, I'll be listening like ''what happened?''\nI gotta make sure I ain't gotta go break jaws\nOr have my goons in your hotelroom on the 8th floor\nBefore this Twitter shit y'all ain't even know I was funny\nCause in every rhyme I uttered I gave you the gutter from me\nI got a sense of humor, see, I ain't have a choice\nYour jokes had to be fly when you came up bummy\nNope, no money, yup, so hungry\nWhen food fell on the floor we picked it up in a hurry\nSaying ''God made dirt'' and dirt don't hurt\nReally, I stomach like throwing that out ain't gone work\nYeah, I started from the bottom now I'm here\nNot the top, not the bottom, I'm somewhere\nIn the middle, not coach, not a layer\nAin't wake up in a new Bugatti, but I steer\nThrough these New York streets, I see clear in my rear\n-view-mirror all the bad bitches stare\nGuess I'm rolling smooth enough to things I'm doing in this truck\nPlease, no jury duty, man, I swear (no joke)\nAnyway, to all my fans, yo, I'm sorry\nI gotta end this verse, but these niggas know they can't harm me\nDon't ever try to keep me out the party\nInvited or uninvited, I'll be in there with my army", "date": "2013-04-22", "title": "5 AM in

thing I ever did was recite my own words\nAt a service realizing the person I was addressing\nProbably wasn't looking down from heaven\nOr cooking up something in hell's kitchen\nTrying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension\nIt was self serving just like this is\n\nConveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas\nThe television went from being a babysitter to a mistress\nTechnology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance\n'til we just stayed distant and never touched\nNow all we do is text too much\n\nI don't remember much from my youth\nMaybe my memory is repressed\nOr I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex\nFell in love for the first time in 4th grade\nBut I didn't have the courage to talk to her\nIn 8th

cooked\nStick a fork it me\nThe jig is up\nI blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder\nIt became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer\n\nAt least I didn't include my name\nThankfully I wrote the whole note in code and it had 10 layers\nOf scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open\nPlus, it was set to self destruct\nWhoever read it probably died... laughing\nI wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened\n\nA year later, I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her\nI had someone else to obsess over\nI was older\nI was very mature\nI forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph\nCause I was failing math\nDisconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home\n\nI checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road\nSteamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode\nIf you snoop around long enough for something in particular\nYou're guaranteed to find it\nFor better or worse that's how I learned\nThat it's best to just keep some things private\nIt was the best of times\nIt was the end of times\n\nIt was the best of times\nIt was the end of times\nI was always on deck, I was next in line\nAn only child with a pen and pad\nWriting a list of things that I could never have\nThe walls in my house were paper thin\nEvery squabble seemed to get deafening\nIf my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things\nProbably to keep from being embarrassed\nNever meant to upset or give grief to my parents\nKept my secrets... hid my talents...\nIn my head, never under the mattress\n\nTherapy couldn't break me\nNever learned a word that would insure safety\nSo I spoke softly and I tip toed often\nThe door to my room was like a big old coffin\nThe way that it creeked when I closed it shut\nAnxieties peaked when it opened up\nAs if everything that I was thinking would be exposed\nI still sleep fully clothed\nIt was the best of times\nIt was the end of times\n\nIt was beautiful\nIt was brutal\nIt was cruel\nIt was business as usual\n\nHeaven\nIt was hell\nUsed to wonder if I'd live to see 12\n\nWhen I did I figured that I was immortal\nLoved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal\nCouldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend bust a move with any other dudes\n\nTone Loc was talking bout a \"Wild Thang\" but I was still caught up in some child thangs\nScared of a God who couldn't spare the rod\nIt was clearly a brimstone and fire thang\n\nPyromaniac\nKleptomaniac\nCouldn't explain my desire to steal that fire\nNow I add it to my rider\nLike \"Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!\" It was the best of times\nIt was the end of times\n\nThe school counselor was clueless cause I never skipped classes\nPerfect attendance\nImperfect accent\nSpeech impediment they could never really fix and I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses\n\nConsidered doing something that would cripple me\nI wanted a wheelchair\nI wanted the sympathy\nI wanted straight teeth so then came braces\n4 years of head gear helped me change faces\nIt was the best of times\nIt was the end of times\n\nNow I wonder if I'll live to see marriage\nWonder if I'll live long enough to have kids\nWonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids\nIf I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is\n\n\"Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years\nDon't let anybody protect your ears\nIt's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear\nIt's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers\nBeer won't give you chest hair\nSpicy food won't make it curl\nWhen you think you've got it all figured out and then

the colours would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony\nAnd where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see, Ha!\nI never knew art til I saw your face and there'll never be one to take your place\n'Cause each and every time you touch the spray paint can\nMichelangelo's soul controls your hand\nThen serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head\nCrescendo of colours hang in tune, Man why oh why d'ya have to die so soon?\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust, where the good die young it's all thy must\n'Cause as life must live, death must die and the tear shall fall from the living eye, Huh!\nThe teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind\nIn love and alone, but now you're dead, and she still can't get you out of her head, Huh!\nMore tears fall for all you've done, trying to be a good father to your only son\nBut now who's gonna make sure that he's fed, put a shirt on his back and a roof overhead?\nTell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities in the islands genes?\nWhen your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing\nBums on the sidewalk, garbage in the streets, abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete\nThe ladies on the corner are selling their bodies, and everybody wants a part in that party\nI'm hanging out tough, rocking late at night, running wild in the town of the neon light\nYou either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh!\nYou gotta make something outta nothing at all\nI'm sitting in the classroom learning the rules and it says you can't do graffiti in school\nThey can't be wrong in the hallowed hall, so my notebook turned into a brick wall\nThe heart of a lion and the courage of three, and the mind of a man much wiser than me\nYou're the soul of the brother who won't come back\nWho died in my arms on the railroad track\n'Cause I'm caught in the rat race, looking for my own space\nThere's gotta be a better place for you and me\nThere's pie in the sky, and an eye for an eye\nSome people gotta die just to be free\nYou search for justice and what do you find?\nYou find just us on the unemployment line\nYou find just us sweating from dawn to dusk\nThere's no justice, there's Huh, just us, Ha!\nStill life urban masterpiece, your trademark was written on trains and walls\nA million dollar gift only God released, and yet you got killed for nothing at all\nSo after this there'll be no more hard times, no more bad times and no more pain\nNo more chump change, none of that bull\nJust movies, museums and the hall of fame\nSo all you Hip Hops get on up, and let's take it to the top where we belong\n'Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here\nEverybody let's sing along, now c'mon, say 'Ho!'

that\nBut when they saw me on the stage I took it right back\n\nCause I dress like a pimp and I work like a ho\nAnd rappin' is the only life I know\nI got respect on the street so wherever I go\nAnd they only get respect when they doin' a show\n\nCause their young dumb try to get some\nIn the process forgot where they come from\nBut what they can't see while their running the game\nIs that their

people to see\nI'm gonna kick down his door and rock his family\nHis girl, the nation, his whole generation\nAnd I'll even give myself a rock sensation\n\nCause I never had a fight when I'm on the

would all freeze it was ten degrees\nI would see my mother bow to her knees\nShe cried then nod then prayed to God\nThat times for the kids wouldn't be so hard\n\nBut out on the streets a life was rougher\nThe dream of getting rich made a man tougher\nTwenty might get you forty, forty might get you eighty\nEighty for a lady that's five foot shady\n\nStaying in the gutter hanging with my brother\nMy pop's got so drunk he use to stutter\nBeat up on my mother, for no reason why\nAnd to this day I try not to get high\n\nThe streets got it good so I should warn you\nThere's a drug store setup right on the corner\nSelling dope, smoke, smack and crack a lack a lack\nThe sess mess splif or the chunk chunky black\n\nTemptation reached for my vein\nBut I didn't let drugs overcome my brain\nBecause drugs rule the body and mess with your head\nAnd makes you part of the living dead\n\nBut I went to school and I learned too good\nI learned to understand all that I could\nThought I could skip a letter from l to z\nSo I took to the streets for my college degree\n\nMy teachers were the hustlers, garbage and bums\nMy class was survival and school was the slums\nMath was counting money large candy no doubt\nAnd my homework was knocking sucker niggas out\n\nGym was when I had to run from the cops\nAnd history was who was on top\nI would hear about the death of the neighborhood crooks\nI didn't want to be in those history books\n\nSo I got myself legal as easy as pie\nA legal crook got a suit and tie\nLike a crooked politician selling dreams and lies\nSo he can rob you blind then tell you why\n\nGet the most for less then pocket the rest\nKick backs, hit backs, invest your interest\nBuild a better bomb then raise the tax\nYou know the king would put the truth on wax\n\nBecause I'm the kind of king that'll open doors\nLet me live my life and you live yours\nDo what you wanna' do and don't hurt nobody\nAnd come on everybody let's party that party\n\nAnd throw

are filled with crooks and trannies\nBam bam got a shooter like Lagassee\nEmerald green paper that I split up with my posse\nOne hand driving, 3 gram smoking\n2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking\nStrength of a retard the drugs are even stronger\nShorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through\nOver fishing make the snapper less affordable\nI hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical\nLike \"do you want to have sex?\", well bitch, it's obvious\nHer name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia\nShe grew a bush like a baby plant\nStill I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams\nSmuggle cheeses in a baby bag\nAnd then I serve at a private tasting\nI got no time for wasting\nJust dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation\nAnd prime rib

inflicted on me solely\nPain within running deeper than the ocean floor\nOcean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo\nPain within running deeper than the ocean floor\nOcean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo\nThat was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed\nI hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June\nAnd I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting\nDemons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted\nOr maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted\nOr take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance\nI think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it\nBut yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet\nIt's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it\nI pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me\n\n[Bridge: Big Body Bes]\n\n[Verse 3: Action

lot of revenge\nAnd your so called friends really ain't your friends\nSo how do you know who you're able to trust\nIf you think about the past look what happened to us\nI never trust no one, I only trust myself\nOr I would've been a victim like everyone else\nIn friendship or hardship whenever you need me\nJust give me a call G I won't deceive thee\nThese fools be shakin' best believe they're

California\n5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it\nHave your ass on \"America's Most Wanted\"\nBut I don't slang or even gang-bang\nAnd though my old school homies do the same thang\nI still got love cause you gotta live\nSo you can give\nAnd raise a family G\nBut you gotta do your best slangin D-O-P-E\nSo keep a grip on yourself and stay mellow\nAnd welcome to the ghetto\n(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)\n\n(chorus) 4x\nWelcome to the ghetto\n(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)\n\n(Verse 2)\nFrom across the seas comes cocaine\nBut you never seen a black man fly the plane\nLook at the news:a young black death\nWas it drug related,take a guess\nI flash when I look in the mirror black\nCause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat\nI think about genocide\nAnd have thoughts of my homies who died\nEverybody backstabbin\nBut I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin\nDeath\nGives a shit about your color\nBut yet I see mo dead young brothas\nI'm goin crazy out here\nSeein 24 brothas die by the end of the year\nAnd I still gotta deal with the 5-0\nAnd I stopped sellin dope in 9-0\nBut if I came to it\nI probably still do it\nPut a Nine in my draws get straight to it\nI hope that I never see the day\nThat I get 20 years for a cake\nB-K-A as a key\nSo open up the door for the\nMo money\nBut I ain't gotta do that G\nCause I'm down with the F-A to the C to the U to the L-T-Y\nG-nut X-tra Large\nAnd S-P-I-C-E make niggas feel like jello\nAnd welcome to the ghetto\n(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)\n\n(chorus) 4x\n\nWelcome to the ghetto 7x\n\n(Verse 3)\nAin't no justice its just us\nAnd any nigga with the guts loves to bust\nAt the police niggas can't get peace\nSendin' troops to the ghetto like the middle east\nMy homie on the block got beat down\nAnd he never sold an ouce, a key, a pound\nSuicide was a notion, sometimes I wanna run and dive in the ocean\nBut killin' myself ain't the answer cause the problems of the world need a cure like cancer\nAnd everybody see the problem but the president and he ain't livin' in the ghetto so that's evident\nI quit pullin' over, fuck the police\nCause they beat Rodney King like a savage beast\nNow motherfuckers on my block think its Glock time\nOpen up season on cop time\nSo welcome to the ghetto\nWhere niggas try to play yo ass like a cello\nThe mayor got the projects boarded up\nAnd the white and the blacks all sorted up\nMy people livin' in poverty\nAnd everytime i wanna' max I'm on a motherfuckers property\nMake me wanna' get the gat to and peel a cap to i gives a fuck about the tattoo\nTears, spendin' years in the P-E-N\nCop dead gone with the wind\nFuck love in the ghetto see\n187 THOUSAND G!", "date": "1992-04-14", "title": "Welcome to the Ghetto"},

mach den R\u00fccken gerade und werde jeden Tag nur st\u00e4rker\nIch bleib hart, weil ich euch nicht vertraue, weil meine Schw\u00e4che euch st\u00e4rkt\nUnd so bleibt der Zwiespalt der Frage, \u00f6ffne oder verschliesse ich mein Herz\nIch wache morgens fr\u00fch auf, aus der Traum von heiler Welt\nDoch ich bleib hart und hab erkannt, dass nur ich bestimme, was z\u00e4hlt\nEs ist lricht zu

Its a miracle to walk away and be alive. With out a scratch on my body it's the last time. I'm going to try my hardest to make wiser decisions. In my present I'm going to shut up and listen.
