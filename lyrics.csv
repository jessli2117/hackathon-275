work tortuous long sessions hours hours talks resisted dont need go agony remember day camp david came haldeman came first said disagree decision totally said think going eventually youre going live regret erlichman came knew erlichman bitter felt strongly shouldnt resign although even indicated perhaps haldeman go stay said know john erlichman went bed last night hoped almost prayed wouldnt wake

responsibility law enforcement attorney general chief law enforcement officer one chief responsibility seeing laws united states enforced meet responsibility extent meet responsibility extent within law cases going right edge law trying advise erlichman haldeman rest best present cases thought legally innocent came edge circumstances would say reasonable person could call coverup didnt think coverup didnt intend coverup let say intended coverup believe id done know could done easy could done immediately election simply giving clemency everybody whole thing would gone away couldnt said clemency wrong come key point let answer way feel american people mean whether resigned earlier say well forces rationalise give carefully prepared cropped statement didnt expect question frankly though im going give tell tell think said one moments youre thinking sometimes say things really heart youre thinking advance say things know tailored audience lot difficult meetings last days
